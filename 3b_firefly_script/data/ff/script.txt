INT. BAR
Belly dancer and men playing cards, middle eastern music playing. Pan up MAL in brown coat playing chinese checkers. He's sitting with an ZOE and JAYNE
JAYNE: (to MAL) Your move.
MAL moves pieces.
ZOE: (to Mal) That's a bold move. 
MAL: I live on the edge. 
Mal takes a swallow of his drink. Zoe moves her pieces. 
JAYNE: (to MAL) Nice work, dumbass. 
MAL: I'd given some thought to movin' off the edge -- not an ideal location -- thinkin' a place in the middle.
MAN: (O.S.) Toast! Toast! 
the noise continues
MAN: QUIET! SHUT UP! 
(Camera moves to a MAN, standing at the bar. He's large, bald, and drunk -- and his name is LUND.)
LUND: I'm, uh, I got words... I'm sayin' this is an a'spicious day. 
(Camera moves to MAL, looking uncomfortable and serious.)
LUND: We all know what day it is. 
JAYNE: (quietly, to MAL) Suspicious... what day is it? 
(The camera moves back to LUND.)
LUND: A glorious day, for all the proud members of the allied planets. Unification day! 
Pumps his fist for emphasis
(The camera moves back to MAL, who closes his eyes as if in pain, then looks at ZOE, then back at LUND.)
LUND: The end of the scumbag independents, the dawn of a new galaxy! 
Rough cheers burst from the crowd. MAL starts to get up.
ZOE: Captain? 
MAL: (leaving the table) I just feel the need for another drink.
JAYNE: (confused, half to himself) What month is it?
MAL walks to the bar, and stands next to LUND, leaning forward to get the bartender's attention.
MAL: (ordering drink) [Ching zie lie ee bay Ng-Ka-Pei? - Can I have one more glass of Ng-Ka-Pei, please?"]
LUND: Hey, you gonna drink t'the Alliance wi' me? Six years today, the Alliance sent the browncoats running, pissing their pants.
Looks at MAL, considering.
LUND: Y'know, your coat is kinda a brownish color. 
MAL: It was on sale. 
MAL downs his drink. 
LUND: You didn't toast? Y'know, I'm thinkin' you one of them independents 
MAL: And I'm thinkin' you weren't burdened with an overabundance of schooling. So why don't we just ignore each other, til we go away? 
MAL turns away from LUND and faces the bar. 
LUND: The Independents were a bunch of cowardly inbred pisspots. Shoulda been killed off of every world spinnin'. 
MAL sets down his drink, stone faced. Turns to Lund.
MAL: (edge of anger to it) Say that to my face. 
The both stand, getting into each others' face. 
LUND: (slowly) I said, you're a coward, and a pisspot. Now what are you gonna do about it? 
MAL: (chipper) Nothin'. I just wanted you to face me so she could get behind ya. 
LUND turns, and his face meets ZOE'S fist. 
MAL: (to ZOE) Drunks are so cute. 
Entire bar pretty much gets up slowly, looking mighty pissed. 
MAL: [Oh juh jen sh guh kwai luh duh jean jan. - "Oh, this is a happy development..."]
ZOE: Jayne... 
(Camera pans to JAYNE, feet on the table and looking relaxed.)
JAYNE: Hey, I didn't fight in no war. Best of luck, though. 
JAYNE drinks. 
(Camera moves back to MAL and ZOE.)
MAL: Fine. Let's do this. 

EXT. BAR - DAY
A large window, which turns out to be some sort of field rather than glass. We know this because it shifts as MAL comes flying through it. Zoom in on MAL, bringing his communicator to his mouth. 
MAL: (into com) Wash, we've got some local color happening. Your grand entrance would not go amiss. 
(Cut to front of the building. ZOE is pushing two men around. The men and ZOE and MAL fight)
MAL: (to ZOE) Is Jayne even awake? 
(Cut to front of the building. JAYNE comes out fighting, a few more men getting pushed around by his barstool. lots of punching and fighting. Zoe head-butts someone. The fight continues until...)
MAL: (looking down. Way down.) Woah woah... haha! 
ZOE, MAL, and JAYNE are backed up against the edge of a cliff. 
MAL: There's just an acre of you fellas. 
MAL: (to ZOE) This is why we lost, you know. Superior numbers. 
ZOE: Thanks for the re-enactment, sir. 
MAN from earlier comes out, big gun in hand, pointed at MAL. The two men flanking him also draw their guns. 
JAYNE: Hey, them ain't kosherized rules. 
LUND: I'm thinkin' somebody needs to put you down, dog. What do you think? 
MAL: I'm thinkin' we'll rise again. 
A whir of noise and dust as a space ship appears behind MAL, ZOE, and JAYNE. A voice comes over the loudspeaker. Twanging music begins. 
WASH: (O.S.) Every man there go back inside, or we will blow a new crater in this little moon. 
The men go back inside. ZOE, MAL, and JAYNE board the ship. MAL waves goodbye to the men. 

INT. SERENITY - CARGO AREA 
JAYNE: Damn yokels can't even tell a transport ship ain't got no guns on it. 
JAYNE: (laughs) "Blow a new crater in this moon." (laughs) 
JAYNE walks off screen. We follow MAL and ZOE up the stairs and into the cockpit. 
MAL: My thanks Wash, nice save as always. 
WASH: A pleasure. 
MAL: And how are our passengers? 
KAYLEE slides out from under the instrument panel. 
KAYLEE: They're fine. So... 
KAYLEE: (excited) ... what happened? Was there a terrible brawl? 
Camera pans to ZOE, sitting close to WASH 
ZOE: Oddly enough, there was. 
WASH: (to MAL) Are you gettin' my wife into trouble? 
MAL: Wha? I didn't start it! Just wanted a quiet drink. 
ZOE: (deadpan) Funny, sir, how you always seem to find yourself in an Alliance-friendly bar come U-day, looking for a "quiet drink." 
MAL: See, this is another sign of your tragic space dementia, all paranoid and crotchety. Makes it hard. 
(Camera moves to KAYLEE as she laughs at the banter, then swings to WASH)
WASH: Did we at least make a contact? 
MAL: (pulling out a piece of paper) Ladies and menfolk, we have ourselves a job. 
ZOE grabs the paper with a smile. 
MAL: Take us out of the world, Wash, got us some crime to be done. 

EXT. Serenity moving off. 


INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY 
RIVER is on the table, asleep. Flashback to RIVER undergoing torture.
RIVER screams and jumps off the table. 
SIMON: River? 
RIVER is crying, kneeling against the wall. 
SIMON: River, it's okay, it's me. 
RIVER continues to cry, her hands over her ears. 
SIMON: You know who I am? 
RIVER: (duh) Simon. 
SIMON: Were you dreaming? 
RIVER stands, slowly. 
SIMON: Did you dream about the Academy? 
RIVER: It's not relevent. 
SIMON: If you can talk about what happened there, and I know it's hard but, the more I know, the faster you'll get better. 
RIVER: (quietly) This isn't home. 
SIMON: (gently) No. No, we can't go home. If we go home, they'll just send you back to the Academy. This is safer now. 
RIVER just shakes her head and looks upset. 
SIMON: (cheerfully) We're on a ship. 
RIVER: (looking around) Midbook Transport. Standard radio and accelerator core. Class code 03-K64--Firefly. 
MAL: (entering room) Well, that's somethin'. I can't even remember all that. 
MAL walks over to the sink, and starts washing his hands. 
SIMON: Need a weave on that? 
MAL: It's nothin' 
SIMON: I expect there's someone's face feels differently. 
MAL: Well, they tell ya, never hit a man with a closed fist, but it is on occasion hilarious. 
MAL dries his hands. 
SIMON: I suppose so. So the, ah, the fight (looking over at RIVER) ...didn't umm, draw any, umm, any attention. 
MAL: No Feds. Just an honest brawl between folks. Ain't none of us wanted the Alliance on us, Doctor, that's why you're here. 
SIMON: I thought I was here because you needed a medic. 
MAL: Well, not today. 
MAL walks out. 
RIVER: (staring after him) Mal, bad. In the Latin.

INT. SERENITY - OUTSIDE OF INFIRMARY 
MAL: Shepherd Book. 
BOOK: Captain! How's the girl? 
MAL: Just a little whimsical in the brainpan. Seems calm enough though. 
In the background, RIVER can be seen freaking out through the windows of the medical bay. 
BOOK: That young man's very brave. 
MAL: (mock seriousness) Yeah. He's my hero. 
BOOK: Gave up everything to free his sister from that place. Go from being a doctor on the Central Planets to hiding on the fringes of the system. There's not many would do that. 
MAL: Suppose not. 
MAL starts to walk off. 
BOOK: Not many would take them in, either. 
MAL stops. 
BOOK: Why did you? 
MAL: Same reason I took you on board, Shepherd. I need the fare. 
MAL starts walking up the stairs. Book follows him with a laugh. 
BOOK: There's neither of can pay a tenth what your crew makes on one of your "jobs". 
MAL: Are you referring to our perfectly legitimate business enterprises? 
BOOK: I'm wondering why a man so anxious to fly under Alliance radar would house known fugitives. The Alliance had her in that institution for a purpose, whatever it was, and they will want her back. You're not overly fond of the boy, so why risk it? 
MAL: Only cause it's the right thing to do. 
MAL looks at the engine room. It's a mess. 
MAL: Oh, would you look at this? Kaylee! 
MAL and BOOK keep walking. 
BOOK: I begin to wonder if you yourself know why you're doing it. 
MAL: Well what about you, Shepherd? How come you're flying about with us brigands? I mean, shouldn't you be off bringing religiosity to the fuzzy-wuzzies or some such? 
BOOK: Oh, I've got heathens aplenty right here. 
MAL: If I'm your mission, Shepherd, best give it up. You're welcome on my boat, God ain't. 
MAL walks off. 
MAL: (to himself) Where the hell's that girl? 

INT. INARA'S SHUTTLE 
INARA is brushing KAYLEE'S hair. 
INARA: Do you want me to put it up? 
KAYLEE: No, that's okay. 
INARA: You have such lovely hair. I'm sure the Doctor would agree.  
KAYLEE: Who? Simon? No, he's much too, I mean I'm just -- do you think it looks better up? 
INARA: We can experiment. We might even get wild later and wash your face. 
KAYLEE: Do you ever do this for your clients? 
INARA: Very occasionally. Not all of them have enough hair to get a brush through. 
KAYLEE: Have you ever had to service a really hideous client? With boils and the like? 
INARA: A Companion chooses her own clients, that's Guild law. But physical appearance doesn't matter so terribly. You look for a compatibility of spirit. There's an energy about a person that's difficult to hide, you try to feel that-- 
MAL walks in, and interrupts. 
MAL: And then you try to feel the energy of their credit account. It has a sort of aura. 
INARA: (pissed) What did I say to you about barging into my shuttle? 
MAL: That it was manly and impulsive? 
INARA: Yes, precisely. Only the exact phrase I used was "don't". 
MAL: Well, you're holding my mechanic in thrall. And Kaylee, what the hell's goin' on in the engine room? Were there monkeys? Some terrifying space monkeys maybe got loose? 
KAYLEE: I had to rewire the grav thrust because somebody won't replace that crappy compression coil. 
MAL: Well get the place squared away. It's dangerous in there, and I ain't paying you to get your hair played at. 
KAYLEE: [Kuh ooh duh lao bao jurn. - "Horrible old tyrant..."]
KAYLEE gets up and goes to do what she's told. 
MAL: (to KAYLEE) We work before we play. 
He turns and watches INARA collect her tea things. 
MAL: You're servicing crew now? 
INARA: In your lonely, pathetic dreams. What do you want? 
MAL: We have a job. 
INARA: Congratulations. This job wouldn't be on a decently civilized planet where I could screen some respectable clients perhaps? 
MAL: Respectable clients, it seems a contradiction. 
INARA: (interrupting) Don't start. 
There is something that is intended to be UST. 
MAL: There's, umm... We haven't gotten a location yet. We'll be landing on the Skyplex in a bit. Run by a fellow called Niska. 
INARA: Never heard of him. 
MAL: Well I have. While we're there, you'll stay confined to the ship. 
INARA: Is the petty criminal perchance ashamed to be riding with a Companion? 
MAL: (serious) This guy has a very unlovely rep. He's got work for me, fine. But I don't...
MAL: (pauses) I'm not sure you'd be safe. 
INARA: (smiling) Mal, if you're being a gentleman, I may die of shock. 
MAL grunts, and bows, walking off. He turns around and walks back towards INARA.
MAL: Have you got time to do my hair? 
INARA: Out. 


INT. SKYPLEX. 
CROW, a buff man with tattoos opens the door. 
NISKA: (O.S.) He's fine. Crow, they can come in. And Malcolm Reynolds is which? 
MAL: I'm Captain Reynolds. My First Mate Zoe, this is Jayne. 
NISKA: Very nice. I am Adelai Niska. You have seen Crow. He likes to stand at the door to say Boo! 
MAL: We got word you might have a job for us. 
NISKA: (standing) Yes! Yes, an exciting job. A train has, eh, something I need. You have worked a train before? 
MAL: We did a few. 
NISKA: Are you going to ask me what it is I need? 
MAL: As a rule, no. 
NISKA: Yes. Good! You have reputation! Malcolm Reynolds gets it done is the talk. 
MAL: Well, I'm glad to hear that. 
NISKA: You know what is reputation? Is people talking. Is gossip. I also have reputation. And not so pleasant I think you know. Crow? 
Crow swings open a door to reveal a man hanging by his feet, looking pretty gorram tortured to death. 
NISKA: (to Mal) Now for you, my reputation is not from gossip. You see this man. Eh, he does not do the job. I show what I do him, and now my reputation for you is fact, is solid. You do the train job for me, then you are solid. No more gossip. 
MAL: Right. 
NISKA: Oooh. You do not like I kill this man. 
MAL: Oh, no. I'm sure he was a very bad person. 
NISKA: My wife's nephew. At dinner, I'm getting earful. There is no way out of that. So, oh! The train job. Come here! (beckons) 
NISKA turns on a display, indicating train cars. 
NISKA: Here, in fifth car, two boxes. Alliance goods. You don't mind taking from Alliance I think. From your reputation? You get on train at Hancock, headed for Paradiso. You take boxes off, before you reach Paradiso, and deliver to Crow -- (he touches a spot on the display, which lights up) -- here. Half money now, Crow give you other half money at rendezvous point. Anything goes wrong, then, your reputation, only gossip, and things between us, not so solid. Yes? 


INT. TRAIN 
MAL and ZOE are seated in the train car.
MAL: How long till we hit Paradiso? 
ZOE: Another twenty minutes. We should be in the foothills in five. 
MAL: Best get to work. 
They stand. 
ZOE: He's a psycho you know. Niska. 
MAL: He's not the first psycho to hire us, nor the last. You think that's a commentary on us? 
ZOE: I just have an image in my head of a guy hanging from the ceiling. 
MAL: I've got an image of it not being me. Let's do the thing. 

INT. NEW TRAIN CAR
The car is filled with Feds. 
MAL: Hi. 

INT. SERENITY - GALLEY  
BOOK is reading the Bible. 
INARA enters. 
INARA: Shepherd. 
BOOK: Good day. So, how do you think it's going? 
INARA: The caper? Mal knows what he's doing. 
BOOK: How long have you known him? 
INARA: I've been on this ship eight months now. I'm not sure I'll ever actually know the Captain. 
BOOK: I'm surprised a respectable Companion would sail with this crew. 
INARA: It's not always this sort of work. They take the jobs they can get, even legitimate ones. The further you get away from the Central Planets, the harder things are, so this is part of it.  
BOOK: I wish I could help. (off Inara's look) I mean, I don't wanna..not help help, not with the thieving, but... I do feel awfully useless. 
INARA: You could always pray they make it back safely. 
BOOK: I don't think the Captain would much like me praying for him. 
INARA: Don't tell him. 
INARA pours water into a teakettle. 
INARA: I never do. 

INT. TRAIN CAR 
Train car with Feds. MAL and ZOE walk through the car and into a car that looks like cheap transport. 
ZOE: (urgently) Sir, is there some information we might maybe be lacking as to why there's an entire fedsquad sitting on this train? 
MAL: Doesn't concern us. 
ZOE: It kinda concerns me. 
MAL: I mean they're not protecting the goods. If they were, they wouldn't be letting people past 'em. 
ZOE: You don't think that changes the situation a bit? 
MAL: I surely do. Makes it more fun. 
ZOE: Sir? I think you have a problem with your brain being missing. 
MAL: Come on. We stick to the plan. We get the goods, we're back on Serenity before the train even reaches Paradiso, only now we do it under the noses of twenty trained Alliance Feds. And that makes 'em look all manner of stupid. Hell, this job I would pull for free. 
ZOE: (amused) Can I have your share? 
MAL: No. 
ZOE: If you die, can I have your share? 
MAL: Yes. 

INT. SERENITY - CARGO HOLD 
SIMON: Hey. 
KAYLEE: Oh! Hey, Doctor. 
SIMON: You really should just call me Simon. 
KAYLEE: Oh, I'll do that, then. 
SIMON: So, what are we doing? 
KAYLEE: Oh! Crime. 
SIMON: Crime? Good. Okay, crime. 
KAYLEE: It's a train heist. See, we fly over the train car. The Captain and Zoe sneak in, we lower Jayne onto the car, and they bundle up the booty, and we haul 'em all back up. Easy as lyin'. 
SIMON: They've done this before? 
KAYLEE: (laughing) Hell no. But I think it's gonna work. The Captain's [jen duh sh tyen tsai - "an absolute genius"] when it comes to plans. 
SIMON: Uh, well, uh... Is there anything I can... something I should be doing? 
JAYNE enters from behind SIMON.
JAYNE: Stayin' the hell outta everyone's way. 
KAYLEE: There's no call to be snappy, Jayne. 
JAYNE: You about to jump on a movin' train? Captain ain't around. I'm in charge. 
KAYLEE: Since when? 
JAYNE: And just cause Mal say's you're Medic, don't make you part of the crew. 
Pan up to RIVER sitting on the catwalk, watching them. 
JAYNE: You just, play at figurin' what's wrong with that moonbrained sister of yours till we call for ya. [Dong ma? - "Understand?"] 
SIMON: Right. 
SIMON walks off. A rope lowers. It's what will be attached to JAYNE so he can jump on the train. 
KAYLEE: You shouldn't be so rude to him. 
JAYNE: Why? Cause he's all rich and fancible? 
KAYLEE: He's not rich. The Alliance crashed his accounts when he snuck out his sister. 
JAYNE: Well, we could all be rich if we handed her back. 
KAYLEE: You're not even thinking that. 
JAYNE: Mal is. 
KAYLEE: That's not funny. 
(Camera pans up to RIVER, watching them from above, her face shadowed and still.)
JAYNE: (O.S.) He ain't stupid. Why would he bring on trouble like those two if there weren't no profit in it?
(camera moves back to Kaylee, locking the rope on JAYNE) 
JAYNE: Captain's got a move he ain't made yet, you'll see. 
JAYNE pulls on a ridiculous hat with floppy ear covers and a chin strap. 
JAYNE: Time for some thrilling heroics. 

INT. TRAIN - CAR WITH STUFF 
MAL is swiping a card in a reader. 
MAL: Niska's sources better be good. 
The card works. The door slides open.
ZOE: Shiny. 

INT. TRAIN - FED CAR 
A FED stands up, and walks back towards the car where MAL and ZOE are breaking in for Crime Time. 

INT. TRAIN - CAR WITH STUFF 
MAL pulls a box to the middle of the car, stands on it, and starts unscrewing a roof panel. 
MAL: (to ZOE) Find the cargo. 
ZOE pulls a sheet off of two black boxes with red labels. 
ZOE: All hail the great Alliance. 

EXT. TRAIN 
Serenity is moving over the train, approaching from the rear, so they can drop JAYNE into the portal MAL will open. 

INT. SERENITY-CARGO HOLD 
A hatch opens. JAYNE pulls on goggles. 

INT. SERENITY - COCKPIT 
WASH steering. He's wearing a black muscle shirt. 

INT. SERENITY-CARGO HOLD 
JAYNE drops through the hatch. 

EXT. TRAIN  
JAYNE lands on the train with a grunt. 

INT. TRAIN - CAR WITH STUFF 
MAL pulls off the panel, leaving an opening for JAYNE 

INT. TRAIN - CHEAP CAR. 
FED cocks his gun. 

INT. TRAIN - CAR WITH STUFF 
JAYNE drops through the hole. MAL pats him on the back. They attach the cargo to the rope bucket thing. 
MAL: (into com) Fifteen seconds. 

INT. SERENITY-CARGO HOLD 
KAYLEE waits 

INT. SERENITY - COCKPIT 
WASH flies. 

INT. TRAIN - CAR WITH STUFF 
FED enters. The smoke trap they've set up goes off. FED shoots. JAYNE'S leg takes a hit.  
ZOE: (to JAYNE) Gorram! 
JAYNE : (into com) GO! Go now! 

INT. SERENITY-CARGO HOLD 
KAYLEE starts pulling him up w/ the stuff. 

INT. TRAIN - CAR WITH STUFF 
Fistfight. FED gets knocked out. 
MAL: (to ZOE) Come on! 
MAL and ZOE start running through the cars. 

INT. SERENITY - COCKPIT 
WASH flies. 

INT. TRAIN 
Smoke. 

INT. SERENITY-CARGO HOLD 
JAYNE is collapsing as the stuff is lowered. 
KAYLEE: Where are the others? 
JAYNE: Ah! They shot my gorram leg. 
KAYLEE: Jayne, are they still on the train? Are they gonna be okay? 

EXT. TRAIN, stopped. 
VOICE: Everybody off. Everybody in there okay? 
 
EXT. PARADISO 
It's a small, ragged town. Very dusty and Westerny. MAL and ZOE are standing with their backs to a FED and the SHERIFF. 
FED: Our man didn't get a look. 
SHERIFF: Well, Jesus, can somebody find out what they took?
SHERIFF: (to someone in the crowd) Handy! Keep those people together. 
His Deputy wanders up. 
DEPUTY: It's the medicine, sir. All of the supplies. 
SHERIFF: They stole the gorram medicine? 
ZOE and MAL look grim. 
SHERIFF: We've been waitin'... All of it? 
DEPUTY: Every ounce. 
(Camera pans over sad, tearful townspeople.)
SHERIFF: (sighing) God help us. 
MAL: Son of a bitch. 

 
INT. ALLIANCE SHIP. 
ALLIANCE OFFICER is walking into a station. There's an alert. OFFICER turns to ALLIANCE ENSIGN and starts talking. 
OFFICER: What's the fuss? 
ENSIGN: All network alert. Cargo theft. Medical shipment lifted off a train in the Georgia System en route to Paradiso. 
OFFICER: (looking at the alert screen) Six crates of Pasceline D. Right. That'll get you a tidy fortune on the black market. 
OFFICER: (dismissive) Tag it received, bounce it back. Locals can deal with it. 
ENSIGN: Sir, there is a regiment holding in Paradiso. They were on the train, headed for the installation. 
OFFICER: Then get them back on the train and get it moving. Who's holding them there? 
ENSIGN: The Sheriff requested we deploy a few to help them investigate... 
OFFICER: (impatient) These are federal marshals, not local narcotic hounds. They've got better things to do, so do we. 
OFFICER leaves. 
 
INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY 
JAYNE is on the table, sweaty and pissed. 
JAYNE: Gorram it, let's get us moving.  
SIMON: Now, I'm not, I'm not finished.  
JAYNE: (not caring) Why are you parked here? This ain't the [go tsao de - "dog humping"] rendezvous spot. 
WASH: It is now. 
JAYNE: That's cause people are waitin', they ain't partial to waitin'. 
WASH: (sarcastic and firm) Let 'em read a magazine. We don't make the sale until Mal and Zoe are back on the boat. 
JAYNE: These are stone killers, little man. They ain't cuddly like me. 
WASH: I'm not flying anywhere without my wife. 
KAYLEE: (nervously) She'll be okay. She's with the Captain. 
JAYNE: (standing) There, you see? Everybody wins. 
He tries putting his leg down and screams in pain. BOOK is just watching the action. 
JAYNE: Doc, I need a pop to quiet this pain some. 
SIMON goes over to get some medication 
SIMON: (concerned) All right, but what about the authorities? I mean, we're sitting here with stolen Alliance goods. Won't they be looking for us? 
WASH: They buzz this canyon, we'll hear them long before they ever see us. I figure we're good for... 
RIVER: (interrupting) Won't stop. Won't ever stop. They'll just keep coming until they get back what you took. Two by two, hands of blue. Two by two, hands of blue. 
JAYNE: (to River) How's about you shut that crazy mouth? Is that a fun game?
JAYNE: (to everyone) Now I'm in ruttin' charge here, and I'm tellin' you how it works. We don't get the goods to Niska on time, he'll make meat pies out of the lot of us. And I ain't walkin' into that. 
BOOK: Is this Adelai Niska you're talking about? 
SIMON injects JAYNE with a pain shot.  
JAYNE: Now how would a Shepherd know a name like that? 
BOOK: As I've heard it, he made a deal with the Captain. If the Captain's not there to finish it, if Niska finds out he's being held, and may speak as to who hired him -- I think we're better off being a little late. 

INT. PARADISO - HOLDING AREA 
MAL and ZOE are sitting, huddled. Coughing people everywhere. It's a holding area for train passengers. 
MAL: This is a nightmare. 
ZOE: Nothing points to us yet, sir. 
MAL: That ain't what I'm talking about. 
(Long shot of poor, coughing, sick, poor people.)
MAL: Whatever happens, remember I love you. 
ZOE: (confused) Sir? 
MAL: (with a plan) Because you're my wife. 
ZOE: Right. Sir. Honey. 
SHERIFF walks up, paperwork in hands 
SHERIFF: Car 3, Row 12, Mr. and Mrs. Ring? 
MAL: Can you tell us what's going on? We've been here for so long. Did someone on the train get killed? 
SHERIFF: No, no, no. Nothing like that. Ah, says there your fare's paid for by a third party? 
MAL and ZOE stand and follow the SHERIFF to his desk. 
MAL: My uncle. It was a wedding gift. 
SHERIFF: Wedding gift? 
The SHERIFF motions for MAL and ZOE to sit down. 
SHERIFF: Spending your honeymoon in Paradiso?  
ZOE: Actually, we're here lookin' for work. 
SHERIFF: That right? 
MAL: My uncle said he knew a Joey Bloggs out here, said he might have an opening. Thought we'd try our luck. 
SHERIFF: You a miner by trade? Either of you? 
MAL: Not really. 
SHERIFF: Hmm. You don't see many choose this life weren't born to it. 
ZOE: Well, work is real scarce for a couple just starting out. 
MAL: How come there's so many sick here? 
SHERIFF: Bowden's Malady. Know what that is? 
ZOE: Affliction of the bone and muscle. Degenerative. 
SHERIFF: Very. Every planet that's been terraformed for human life has its own little quirks. Turns out the, uh, air down underground, mixed up with the ore processors is a recipe for Bowden's. Everybody gets it. Miners, dumpers. Hell, I got it, I ain't never set foot in a mine. 
ZOE: But it's treatable? 
SHERIFF: There's medicine. Pasceline. Means you can live like a person, you get it regular. But our shipment got stole, right off the train you was riding in. Which is why you won't be seeing a parade in town today. 
MAL: Stolen? Well, didn't I see a whole regiment of fine young Alliance Federals on the train? 
SHERIFF: You did. Same regiment let our medicine get swiped right under their noses, then took off for their own camp without so much as a whoopsy daisy. 
MAL: That sounds like the Alliance. Unite all the planets under one rule so that everybody can be interfered with or ignored equally. 
The SHERIFF gets up, gets a cup of coffee, and sits on his desk, facing MAL and ZOE 
SHERIFF: Alliance ain't much use to us out here on the border planets. But... they ain't the ones that stole the medicine. I ever find those people, they ain't ever going to see the inside of a jail. I'm just gonna toss 'em in a mine, let 'em breathe deep for the rest of their lives. 
MAL: Can't argue with that. 
SHERIFF: Ah. You mind telling me when it was you last spoke to Joey Bloggs? 
MAL: Never did myself.
SHERIFF: Right. Your uncle. It was indicated to you that, uh, Joey had an opening? 
MAL: Any job would do. 
SHERIFF: It's funny your uncle never went to mentioning the Bowden's problem. Or that Joey Bloggs ate his own gun, about eight months back. 
MAL: Did he? 
SHERIFF: Yep. Blew the back of his head right off. 
MAL: (beat) So... would his job be open? 

INT. SERENITY - COCKPIT 
JAYNE is limping up the stairs to where WASH and KAYLEE are sitting. He's followed by about everyone else. Okay, SIMON. 
JAYNE: That's it! We've waited long enough. Let's get this bird in the air. 
WASH: No rutting way 
SIMON: (to Jayne) You really should sit down. 
KAYLEE: You can't just leave the Captain and Zoe here. 
JAYNE: They ain't comin', we can't walk in there and get 'em, so they're done. Now let's fire it up. 
INARA and BOOK walk in. 
INARA: What's going on? 
JAYNE: Strap in, we're takin' off. 
WASH: We're NOT. 
JAYNE: Captain'd do the same if it was one of us. 
KAYLEE: Not in a million years! 
JAYNE: Shove it. 
WASH: Listen to me! 
JAYNE: You know what the chain of command is? It's the chain I go get and beat you with until you understand who's in ruttin' command here. Now we're finishing this deal, and then maybe maybe we'll come back for those morons who got themselves caught. 
JAYNE: (starts breathing heavily) You can't change that by getting all... 
JAYNE: (voice slows) ...bendy. 
WASH: (not understanding the bendy thing) All what? 
JAYNE: (drugged) You've got the light.. from the console.. keep you, lift you up. They shine like...
JAYNE: (tries to catch the light in his hands) ...little angels... 
JAYNE collapses with a thud. The crew just stares. 
WASH: Did he just go crazy and fall asleep? 
SIMON: I told him to sit down. 
KAYLEE: (amazed) You doped him. 
SIMON: It was supposed to kick in a good deal sooner. I, I just didn't feel comfortable with him in charge. I hope... hope that's all right. 
Crew looks around. Yeah. It's all right. 
BOOK: So. How do we get the others? 
WASH: Jayne was right about them not making contact. Chances are, they got pinched getting off that train. 
KAYLEE: We can't just waltz in and pull them out. 
BOOK: Someone respectable enough might be able to. 

INT. PARADISO - HOLDING AREA 
Pan up from flowing rich, red satin. INARA is walking towards MAL and ZOE. 
MAL: What the hell? 
INARA punches him. 
INARA: Don't you dare speak to me. 
INARA: (to Sherrif) Sheriff, I want this man bound by law at once. That's assuming he hasn't been already? 
SHERIFF: No one's been bound, not yet. 
INARA: Thank God you stopped them. 
INARA: (to Mal) Did you honestly think you could access my accounts and I wouldn't find you? And Zoe, what would your husband say if he knew you were here? 
ZOE: I... I was weak. 
SHERIFF: So I take it they ain't newlyweds? 
INARA: Hardly. Malcolm's my indentured man, with three years left on his debt. I imagine we'll have to add another six months after this little adventure. 
SHERIFF: (re: on-looking men gawking at Inara) You'll have to pardon them. Don't think a one of 'em's ever seen a registered Companion before. 
INARA: I apologize for my manner. 
SHERIFF: Oh, not a bit. 
INARA: Should I contact my ship? Do you need to hold them very much longer? 
SHERIFF: Looks to me like we're about done here. I, uh. We had some unrelated trouble. His story had kind of an odor to it. 
INARA: Yes, it's not the only thing about him that does. Thank you, very much Sheriff. 
INARA: (to Mal and Zoe) Come along. 
SHERIFF: (to Deputy) That's one hell of a lady. Her files were all in order? 
DEPUTY: I ran 'em twice. 
SHERIFF: Hmm. Let's get started with the rest, then. 

INT. SERENITY - CARGO AREA 
INARA is stepping off her shuttle. 
KAYLEE: Hey. How'd it go? 
MAL: She hit me. 
WASH hugs ZOE. JAYNE is sprawled unconscious on the stairs. 
KAYLEE: (re: Jayne) We tried to get him into the infirmary, he's just heavy.  
WASH: Captain, I've got the engine running, we're good to go. 
MAL: We're not going. 
WASH: Not? What? Not why? 
ZOE: We're bringin' the cargo back. 
JAYNE: (semi-conscious, slurring) Wha? Whadda mean back? I waited for you guys! 
WASH: What are you talking about? What about Niska? Won't this put him in more or less a killing mood? 
MAL and ZOE are grabbing the cargo. 
MAL: There's others need this more. 
ZOE: Let's get it on the mule. 
INARA: My shuttle's faster. 
MAL: You already risked enough flying in there once. And... I don't wanna get slapped around no more. Far as Niska goes, we'll just have to explain to him the job went south when we return the money. 
WASH: You wanna explain, now's your chance. 
CUE ominous music. They look to the dock. Someone is striding up. It's Niska's men, lead by CROW. 
CROW: You didn't make the rendezvous. 
MAL: Ran into a few complications. 
CROW: You were thinking of taking Mr. Niska's money and his property, maybe. 
MAL: Ah, interestingly, neither. 
CROW: I don't understand. 
MAL: Yeah, look. Here's what it is. Deal's off. (beat, CROW still doesn't get it) We changed our minds. 
CROW: (exasperated) You entered into an arrangement with Mr. Niska. There is no mind changing. 
MAL: (nervous laugh) I'm afraid that's where you're wrong. We just... we can't take this job, so you just relax. We'll get you all the money Niska gave us up front, you return it to him, and we'll call it even. 
CROW: (shakes head) There is no even.
MAL: Is that right? 
CROW throws a knife. It hits MAL in the shoulder. Guns get drawn. ZOE'S included. Shots exchanged. ZOE shoots. People fall. It's a thing. CROW starts punching MAL. WASH uses the mule to drive over some guys. MAL'S on the ground, about to get speared by CROW. A shot rings out. CROW is kneecapped. 
MAL: Nice shot. 
(Camera pans up to JAYNE, smoking gun in hand.)
JAYNE: (slurred) I was aiming for his head. 

EXT. PARADISO - NIGHT 
MAL and ZOE are driving the cargo back. 
MAL: We'll have to drag 'em from here. Leave 'em just off the street. We'll notify the Sheriff when we're in deep, deep space. 
SHERIFF: Why not tell him in person?
CUT TO:  
SHERIFF and his men coming up from over a slight rise. MAL looks shocked, ZOE looks resigned. 
SHERIFF: Got word of a ship not far out, came lookin'. Didn't expect to find you comin' back. 
It's clear now that the SHERIFF and his men are armed and prepared to use those arms if need be. 
MAL: Didn't expect to be comin'. 
The Sheriff's crew inspects the cargo. 
DEPUTY: Nothin' missing. 
SHERIFF looks at MAL, smiles, and looks down in disbelief. 
SHERIFF: You were truthful back in town. These are tough times. If a man can get a job, he might not look too close at what that job is. But a man learns all the details of a situation like ours, well, then he has a choice. 
MAL: (looking stone-cold serious) I don't believe he does. 
A look of understanding passes between them. 
SHERIFF: (to crew) Get these crates back to town. Make yourselves useful. 

EXT. SERENITY - NIGHT 
CROW is on his knees, hands tied behind his back 
MAL: Now this is all the money Niska gave us in advance. You bring it back to him, tell him the job didn't work out. 
(Crow spits) 
MAL: We're not thieves--but we are thieves. Point is we're not takin' what's his. Now we'll stay out of his way the best we can from here on in. You explain that that's best for everyone, okay? 
CROW stands. 
CROW: Keep the money. Use it to buy a funeral. It doesn't matter where you go, or how far you fly. I will hunt you down, and the last thing you see will be my blade. 
MAL: Darn. 
MAL kicks CROW into the engine intakes. Horrible crunching sounds happen. A second one of Niska's henchmen is brought bound before him. 
MAL: Now this is all the money Niska gave us in advance...
HENCHMAN: Oh, I'm good. I speak for everyone. I'm right there with you. 

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMITY  
SIMON is stitching up MAL's shoulder. 
SIMON: You should have let me do this sooner. 
MAL: I have had plenty worse it's just 
MAL: (Simon hits something sensitive) OUCH! 
SIMON: Sorry. 
MAL: Just be careful. Pretty fast thinkin', doping up Jayne. Can't say you've made a lifetime friend. 
SIMON: I'll deal with him. 
MAL: Yeah, I'm not too worried about you. 
MAL: (beat) How's your sister? 
SIMON: The same. One moment she seems perfectly cogent, the next... 
(CAMERA moves to the outside of the infirmary and pans right.)
SIMON: ...she speaks nonsense, like a child. So difficult to diagnose. And I still don't know what the government was trying to do with her, so I have no idea if they succeeded. 
SIMON's voice fades out as RIVER's grows louder. The camera moves in on her. She's curled in a corner, chanting: 
RIVER: Two by two, hands of blue. Two by two, hands of blue... 

INT. ALLIANCE SHIP 
ALLIANCE OFFICER from earlier walks into a room. There are two men in suits there. 
OFFICER: Sorry to keep you waiting. There's always one crisis... 
He's interrupted by the MAN. 
MAN: We're not interested. We're here about a theft. 
OFFICER: The medicine, on that planet. Word came up that was returned. 
OTHER MAN: We didn't fly 86 million miles to track down a box of band-aids, Colonel. 
MAN: We're looking for a girl. 
MAN slides a picture of RIVER across the desk. We see that his hands are encased in tight blue gloves. 
MAN: This girl. 
As the camera pans out, we see that MAN IN SUIT 2 is also wearing blue gloves. 

BLACK OUT. 


INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
There is a noisy game of what looks vaguely like basketball going on. Zoe, Mal, Jayne, Wash, Kaylee and Book are playing.
JAYNE: Yeah, too tall, too tall!
WASH: Jayne!
Jayne passes the ball to Wash.
JAYNE: Little man!
There is lots of vying for the ball. Zoe shoots the ball towards a metal hoop suspended by a chain, and apparently scores. River and Simon watch the game from the walkway above.
VOICE: (O.C.) Yes!
JAYNE: Come on, old man! Ha ha!
Inara enters onto the walkway. Back on the game floor, Kaylee climbs onto Jayne's shoulders, Jayne runs towards the hoop and Kaylee puts it through. Inara crosses over to Simon.
SIMON: Hello.
INARA: Who's winning?
SIMON: I can't tell. They don't seem to be playing by any civilized rules that I know.
INARA: Well, we're pretty far from civilization.
Inara glances at River, who is watching the game intently.
INARA: How's your sister?
SIMON: She's good. Better. She has her days. And she still won't talk about what it was they did to her at the academy.
INARA: Perhaps she's not sure herself.
SIMON: She dreams about it. I know that much. Nightmares. And now, on the run, on this ship, I don't know if I'll be able to help her here, and I need to help her.
INARA: Simon, you are. Leaving your whole world behind. It's incredibly selfless.
SIMON: Yeah. I selflessly turned us both into wanted fugitives.
INARA: Well, we're all running from something, I suppose.
(Cut back to the game. A LOUD ALARM starts sounding.)
ZOE: Proximity alert. Must be coming up on something.
WASH: (alarmed) Oh my god. What can it be? We're all doomed! Who's flying this thing!? 
WASH: (deadpan) Oh right, that would be me. Back to work.
KAYLEE: So I guess that makes us one man short.
JAYNE: Little Kaylee's always one man short.
Kaylee punches Jayne good-naturedly in the arm.
JAYNE: Ow, hey.
KAYLEE: (to Simon) Say Doc, why don't you come on down, play for our side? Inara won't mind.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Wash enters the bridge, and though the viewport sees a spaceship tumbling through space. As he sits down, a human body suddenly bumps into the window. Wash startles, and bumps the flight controls, which causes the entire ship to shudder. Mal and Zoe enter the cockpit.
MAL: Wash, you have a stroke or something?
WASH: Near enough.
ZOE: What happened?
The rest of the crew enters the bridge and regards the slowly spinning spaceship.
JAYNE: [Wu de ma. - "Mother of god."]
MAL: Anybody home?
WASH: Been hailing her, but if whoever's there is as healthy as the guy we just ran over, can't imagine anyone's going to be picking up.
MAL: Bring us in a little closer.
WASH: Get you close enough to ring the doorbell.
SIMON: What is it?
Now we see that River is standing against the wall just outside the doorway of the bridge.
RIVER: It's ghosts.

BLACK OUT.


INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
MAL: So, what do we figure? Transport ship?
WASH: Converted cargo hauler, maybe a short-range scow.
KAYLEE: You can see she don't want to be parked like that. The port thrust's gone, that's what's making her spin the way she is.
SIMON: A short range vessel, this far out in space?
WASH: Retrofitted to carry passengers.
ZOE: Travelers pick them up cheap at government auction. A few modifications and they serve well enough for a one-way push to the outer planets.
BOOK: Settlers.
WASH: Cram fifteen, maybe twenty families on a boat that size, you pack 'em in tight enough.
INARA: Families?
JAYNE: Tell you what I think. I think that fellow we ran into did everyone on board, killed them all, then decided to take a swim through space, see how fast his blood would boil out of his ears.
WASH: You're a very "up" person.
BOOK: Shouldn't we report this?
MAL: To who? Alliance? Right. They're going to run out here lickety-split and make sure these taxpayers are okay.
BOOK: Then we'll have to.
JAYNE: If there's folks on board in need of help, why ain't they beaming no distress call?
ZOE: It's true, there's no beacon.
MAL: Which means it's likely no one's looking to find her.
BOOK: All the more reason for us to do the right thing.
JAYNE: How about you just say a prayer when we slide on by.
BOOK: Shall I remind you of the story of the Good Samaritan?
MAL: I'd rather you didn't. But we'll check it out. See if there are survivors. If not, then, well no one's going to mind if we take a look around, see if there's not something of value they might have left behind.
JAYNE: (suddenly on board with this plan) Yeah, no, uh, someone could be hurt.

EXT. SERENITY
Serenity moves against the derelict ship and links to it. As they join, we see several snaky cables latching onto Serenity from the other ship.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO HOLD
Simon enters carrying a medical kit. Mal and Zoe are getting into space suits. Jayne walks up behind Simon.
JAYNE: Where do you think you're headed?
SIMON: Thought I'd offer my services, in case anyone on board required medical attention.
JAYNE: Well, Cap and Zoe are going in first. We'll holler if we need you.
JAYNE: (off Simon's somewhat worried look) Something wrong?
Simon is watching Mal and Zoe help each other on with their suits.
SIMON: Hmmm? Oh, no. I suppose it's just the thought of a little Mylar and glass separating a person from... nothing.
JAYNE: It's impressive what "nothing" can do to a man. Like that fella we bumped into. He's likely stuck up under our belly about now. That's what space trash does, you know. Kind of latches onto the first big something that stops long enough. Hey now, that'd be a bit like you and your sister now, wouldn't it?

INT. DERELICT SHIP - AIRLOCK
Zoe and Mal enter through the airlock from Serenity, fully suited-up.
MAL: Entering adjoining airlock now. Okay, Wash, ask Serenity to knock for us. 
Quick cut to the bridge, where Wash is listening, and manipulating controls on the panel.

INT. DERELICT SHIP - CORRIDORS
MAL: Emergency power's up. Dashboard lights.
They move into the galley. The ship is deserted and eerie. A child's balloon is tied to the back of a chair. Unfinished meals are still on tables.
MAL: Whatever happened here, happened quick.
They continue exploring the ship.

INT. DERELICT SHIP - BRIDGE
ZOE: Everything was left on. Ship powered down on its own. No sign of a struggle. They're just...
MAL: Gone.
ZOE: (re: a computer screen) Sir. Personal log. Someone was in the middle of an entry.
Zoe taps the screen (or the keyboard), which shorts out.

INT. SERENITY - RIVER'S BUNK
River awakes with a gasp and starts crying. Simon hears her and enters.
SIMON: Shh, shh, it's okay, it's okay, I'm here. Bad dreams again?
RIVER: No, I can't sleep. There's too much screaming.
SIMON: River, there is... there is no screaming.
RIVER: (quietly) There was.
Jayne appears in the corridor, loading a firearm.
JAYNE: Hey! Grab your med kit and let's hoof it. Mal wants us both over there on the double.
SIMON: They found survivors?
JAYNE: Didn't say.
SIMON: Right. I'll ask Inara to look in on River.
JAYNE: Whatever. I ain't waiting. I'll meet you over there. But don't take forever. Still got to get suited up.

INT. DERELICT SHIP - AIRLOCK
Simon enters in a spacesuit, alone, looking nervous. He moves through the dark corridor, his breathing loud and irregular. He enters a small room where we find Jayne, Mal, Zoe and Kaylee, without spacesuits.
MAL: Hi.
Simon realizes he's been had, and struggles to remove his helmet. Kaylee moves to help him.
MAL: Um, what are you doing here, and what's with the suit? Jayne cracks up.
SIMON: (to Jayne) You're hilarious. Sadist.
MAL: All right, enough. Ain't got time for games. As long as you're here, you may as well lend a hand. You can run with Kaylee. Let's be quick about this people, all right? A few loads each, no need to be greedy.
SIMON: Where are all the people?
MAL: Ship says lifeboat launched more than a week ago. We're going to assume everyone got off okay. Anyway, we're just here to pick the bones. You two start in the engine room. Jayne, you take the galley.
KAYLEE: (to Simon, re: his helmet) You, um, had this on wrong.
Jayne laughs maliciously as the three move on to their assigned tasks.
ZOE: Sir, I count sixteen families signed on. Lifeboat wouldn't hold a third of that.
MAL: I know. 
MAL: (into com) Wash, any luck?

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
WASH: (speaking into com) I think I found something pretty well matches that class. Layout looks about right. Seems to me any valuables, if there are any, likely be stored C-deck, aft.

INT. DERELICT SHIP
MAL: Good work. Keep the engine running, shouldn't be long.

INT. SERENITY - CORRIDORS OUTSIDE PASSENGER QUARTERS
Inara is carrying a tray of food.
INARA: River? It's Inara. Are you hungry sweetie?
She knocks on the door and opens it, to find an empty room.
INARA: River?

INT. DERELICT SHIP - AIRLOCK
River enters the ship, barefoot.
SIMON: (O.C.) Aren't you the least bit curious?

INT. DERELICT SHIP - ENGINE ROOM
Simon and Kaylee are investigating the engine room. Well, Kaylee is and Simon is tagging along.
KAYLEE: About what?
SIMON: Well... what happened here. Why would anyone abandon their ship in the middle of nowhere like this?
KAYLEE: For all sorts of reasons. Just not the mechanical.
SIMON: What?
KAYLEE: There ain't nothing wrong with this. Not that I can see, anyhow.
There is an electrical flash and crackling as Kaylee pulls a part from the ship.
KAYLEE: Whoo. Well there's a good one. Hold the bag open.

INT. DERELICT SHIP - GALLEY
Jayne is scooping supplies into a duffel bag, munching on something.

INT. DERELICT SHIP - DECK C, AFT
MAL: This looks to be it.
Zoe tries to open a door set in the side of the wall.
ZOE: Locked.
MAL: Well now. I'd say that's like to be a very good sign.
Mal stoops and removes a blowtorch from his satchel, and proceeds to work on the door.

INT. DERELICT SHIP - CORRIDORS
River is moving dreamily through the dimly lit ship.

INT. DERELICT SHIP - DECK C, AFT
The door falls away, Zoe and Mal enter. They move through the room, which is stacked with trunks and boxes. Zoe opens a case to reveal a child's doll, along with everyday things that would be found in a suitcase. Mal inspects a stack of plastic crates.
MAL: Here. Genseed, protein, crop supplements. Everything a growing family needs to make a fresh start on a new world.
ZOE: Hard subsidies for fourteen-plus families. That's...
MAL: About a fortune. Forget the rest, we just take this stuff. We're going to need a hand hauling it out of here.
ZOE: Sir. Even on a lifeboat, you'd think those who escaped would have found room for some of this.
River has entered the room, and is staring up at something.
MAL: Nobody escaped.
ZOE: Sir?
Mal and Zoe turn their flashlights to the ceiling, to reveal five or six hideous corpses, strung up by chains and gutted.
MAL: Nobody.
ZOE: Oh my god.
MAL: [Jen dao mei. - "Just our luck."] I know what did this. 
MAL: (to Zoe, re: River) Get her out of here. 
MAL: (into com) Jayne? Jayne, drop what you're doing, and get to the engine room. I want you to take Kaylee and the doctor off this boat.

INT. DERELICT SHIP - GALLEY
Jayne is listening to Mal's orders in the dark galley. Suddenly, the lights flash on to reveal a man attacking Jayne from behind. Jayne is knocked into a table; pots and pans go clattering to the floor. From the dropped walkie-talkie we hear Mal's voice.
MAL: Jayne?

BLACK OUT.


INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
WASH: (into com) Captain? Captain. Zoe!

INT. DERELICT SHIP
Mal, Zoe and River are moving quickly though the ship.
ZOE: It came from above, Sir.
MAL: Galley.
They turn a corner to find Kaylee and Simon.
KAYLEE: We heard shooting.
SIMON: River! What are you...?
RIVER: I followed the voices.
SIMON: Don't ever leave the ship. Not ever.
MAL: Handle her, will you son?
WASH: (on com) What the [tyen shiao duh - "God knows what"] is going on in there?
ZOE: (into com) Not now, dear.

INT. DERELICT SHIP - GALLEY
Mal and Zoe move into the galley, where there are signs of a struggle. The others follow. Mal aims his gun at a noise, which turns out to be Jayne, holding a gun on Mal.
MAL: What'd you see?
JAYNE: (panting) Didn't. Came at me from behind. Big, though. Strong. I think I might have hit him.
SIMON: (re: blood on floor) You did.
Mal follows the blood trail to a circular screen covering up a cubbyhole. We can hear gasping coming from inside as Mal removes the screen.
SURVIVOR: No, no, no.
MAL: Shh, easy now. No one's going to hurt you.
There is a young, terrified man hiding in the small space.
SURVIVOR: No, no mercy, no.
MAL: I mean, more than we already did. We got lots and lots of...
Mal slugs the guy, knocking him unconscious. Mal hauls the man out of the hole, dropping him to the floor.
SIMON: (dripping sarcasm) Oh yes, he's a real beast. 
SIMON: (to Jayne) It's a wonder you're still alive.
JAYNE: Looked bigger when I couldn't see him.

INT. SERENITY - OUTSIDE THE INFIRMARY
The crew is gathered, watching through the infirmary window.
INARA: I wonder how long he'd been living like that?
KAYLEE: I don't know. He must be real brave to survive like that when nobody else did.
JAYNE: Yeah, real hero, killing all them people.
KAYLEE: What!? We don't believe that. We don't, do we?
ZOE: Captain wouldn't have brought him on board, were that the case.

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY
Simon is tending to the injured man while Mal observes.
SIMON: Pulse is rapid, blood pressure's the high side of normal. That's to be expected. 
SURVIVOR: Weak, they were all weak.
SIMON: Other than the bullet wound, there doesn't appear to be any exterior trauma. Though that crack in the head you gave him probably didn't do him any good.
SURVIVOR: Cattle. Cattle for the slaughter.
MAL: Dope him.
SIMON: I don't think that's...
MAL: Just do it.
SURVIVOR: No mercy, no resistance.
Simon moves to sedate his patient, and the man grabs his arm.
SURVIVOR: Open up, see what's inside. Simon administers the sedative.
SURVIVOR: (succumbing to the drug) No mercy.

INT. SERENITY - COMMON AREA
Simon and Mal move outside to where the others have been observing.
KAYLEE: So, how's our patient?
SIMON: Aside from borderline malnutrition, he's in remarkably good health.
BOOK: (relieved) So he'll live then.
MAL: Which to my mind is unfortunate.
BOOK: Not a very charitable attitude, Captain.
MAL: Charity'd be putting a bullet in his brainpan.
INARA: Mal!
MAL: Only save him the suffering.
Mal, serious as a heart attack, pulls the door to the infirmary shut.
MAL: All right, no one goes in here. Nothing more we can do for him now, not after what he's seen.
SIMON: What do you mean?
MAL: That ship was hit by Reavers.
JAYNE: Reavers?
WASH: [Tzao gao. - "Crap."]

INT. SERENITY - GALLEY
Mal goes into the galley, getting himself something to drink. The others follow.
INARA: Mal, how can you know?
JAYNE: He don't - that's how. No way. It was that other fella, the one we ran into, like I said before, he went stir-crazy, killed the rest, then took a walk in space.
KAYLEE: Just a second ago you said that...
JAYNE: Don't matter what I said. Reavers don't leave no survivors.
MAL: Strictly speaking, wouldn't say they did.
BOOK: What are you suggesting?
MAL: Doesn't matter that we took him off that boat, Shepherd, it's the place he's going to live from now on.
BOOK: I don't accept that. Whatever horror he witnessed, whatever acts of barbarism, it was done by men, nothing more.
JAYNE: Reavers ain't men.
BOOK: Of course they are. Too long removed from civilization, of course, but men. And, I believe there is a power greater than men, a power that heals.
MAL: Reavers might take issue with that philosophy. If they had a philosophy. If they weren't too busy gnawing on your insides. Jayne's right, Reavers ain't men. Or they forgot how to be. Now they're just nothing. They got out to the edge of the galaxy, to that place of nothing, and that's what they became.
JAYNE: Why're we still sitting here? If it was Reavers, shouldn't we be gone?
MAL: Work ain't done. Still substantial money value sitting over there.
JAYNE: Whoa. I ain't going over there with them bodies, no ruttin' way. Not if Reavers messed with them.
ZOE: Jayne, you'll scare the women.
SIMON: I'll go. I've dealt with bodies, they don't worry me.
BOOK: I'd like to go with him. Maybe see what I can do about putting those folks to rest.
MAL: Those folks already resting pretty good, Shepherd. Reavers saw to that.
BOOK: How we treat our dead is part of what makes us different than those that did the slaughtering.
MAL: All right, you go say your words. Jayne, you'll help the doc and Shepherd Book cut down those people, then you'll load up the cargo.
JAYNE: I don't believe this. We're sitting put for a funeral?
MAL: Yes, Jayne, that is exactly what we're going to do. Not going to have these people looking over my shoulder once we're gone. I'm not saying there's any peace to be had, but on the off chance there is, those folks deserve a little of it.
INARA: Just when I think I've got you figured out.
Inara, Book, Simon and Jayne leave the galley.
KAYLEE: That was real pretty Captain, what you just said.
WASH: I didn't think you were one for rituals and such.
MAL: I'm not, but it'll keep the others busy for a while. No reason to concern them with what's to be done.
ZOE: Sir?

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Kaylee, Wash, Mal and Zoe are looking at a camera feed of the snaky cables we saw latch onto Serenity earlier.
MAL: It's a real burden being right so often.
WASH: What is that?
MAL: Booby trap. Reavers sometimes leave them for the rescue ships. Triggered it when we latched on.
WASH: And when we detach?
MAL: It blows.
WASH: Okay, so we don't detach, we just, I don't know, sit tight until...
ZOE: What, Reavers come back?
KAYLEE: Looks like they've jerry-rigged it with a pressure catch. It's the only thing that'd work with all these spare parts. We could probably bypass that easy, we get to the DC line.
MAL: You tell me right now, little Kaylee, you really think you can do this?
KAYLEE: Sure. Yeah. I think so. 'Sides, if I mess up, not like you'll be able to yell at me.

INT. DERELICT SHIP - C DECK, AFT
Jayne lowers the hanging bodies while Simon and Book look on.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
Zoe and Mal look on while Kaylee lowers herself into a chamber beneath the floor.

INT. SERENITY - INARA'S SHUTTLE
Inara is working on a scroll covered in Chinese calligraphy, while River sleeps on her bed.

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY
The patient is starting to wake, moaning.
SURVIVOR: No, no.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
Kaylee worms her way into a crawl space.

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY
The patient wakes up, laughing.

INT. SERENITY - INARA'S SHUTTLE
River wakes up screaming.

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY
A tray of surgical implements is knocked to the floor. We see a long, sharp knife being picked up by the patient.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
Kaylee clips a line, which oozes a dark viscous liquid. Cut to an exterior shot, where we see the cable disengaging.
Jayne enters, hauling a load of cargo.
JAYNE: What's going on?
MAL: Well, I'd have to say, right at this particular moment, not a thing. Right?
KAYLEE: Not a gorram thing.
JAYNE: Looked like a thing to me.
Book and Simon enter the cargo bay.
MAL: Thought we might have had a situation, but it looks to be taken care of. Let's get that merchandise put away. Cut to a quick shot of Serenity detaching from the derelict. 
MAL: Everyone's home Wash, let's go. The proximity alarm starts sounding again.
JAYNE: Oh no, nonono, don't you say that. It's the Reavers. It's the gorram Reavers come back!
MAL: Get that stuff stored.
JAYNE: Like it's going to matter!
MAL: Just do it!
Mal and Zoe race up the stairs to the bridge.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
MALE_VOICE: (V.O.) Firefly class transport, you are ordered to release control of your helm.
Out the viewport, a huge spaceship looms. It's an ALLIANCE CRUISER.
MAL: Looks like civilization finally caught up with us.

BLACK OUT.


INT. ALLIANCE SHIP
COMMANDER HARKEN watches from the bridge as Serenity moves toward us. An ENSIGN approaches. Harken points to Serenity.
HARKEN: No mandatory registration markings on the bow. Make sure we cite them for that.
ENSIGN: Sir, we've identified the transport ship they were attached to. It was licensed to a group of families out of Bernadette. They were due to touch down in Newhall three weeks ago. Never made it.
HARKEN: Once we secure these vultures, we'll send a team over, check it out.
RADIO OPERATOR: Sir, didn't we have a flag on a Firefly a while back?
HARKEN: Check.
RADIO OPERATOR: Here it is. An alert issued on a Firefly-class, believed to be carrying two fugitives, a brother and a sister.
HARKEN: What are they wanted for?
RADIO OPERATOR: It's uh, it's not available, it's classified.
HARKEN: 40,000 of these old wrecks in the air and that's all they give us. Well, I'm not about to have any surprises on a routine check. We run into these two, we shoot first. The brass can sort it out later.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
Mal is walking quickly along the catwalk.
JAYNE: (to Mal) So what was it?
MAL: Open the stash, pull out the goods.
JAYNE: What? Just got done putting it in.
MAL: Yeah, and I'm telling you to take it all out again.
JAYNE: Why for?
MAL: I got no notion to argue this. In about two minutes time this boat's going to be crawling with Alliance.
The rest of the crew scrambles to get the salvaged goods un-stashed.
SIMON: (horrified) No. We've got to run.
MAL: Can't run. They're pulling us in.
SIMON: If they find us they'll send River back to that place. To be tortured. 
SIMON: (stammering) I'd never see her again.
MAL: Stack everything here, in plain sight. Wouldn't want it to seem like we got anything to hide. It might give them Alliance boys the wrong impression.
WASH: Or the right one.
MAL: That too. 
MAL: (to Simon) Now go run and fetch your sister.
SIMON: What? 
SIMON: (beat) Why, are you going to put her in plain sight, too?
MAL: Don't get tetchy. Just do as I say.
SIMON: Is that why you let us stay? So you could use us as bargaining chips?
JAYNE: I knew there was a reason.
SIMON: (yelling) They are not taking her and you are not giving her to them!
BOOK: (calmly) Don't be a fool son. Do as the man says.
(Cut to exterior shot of Serenity being pulled against the vast Alliance ship. Back in the cargo bay, the doors open to reveal our crew (minus Simon and River) looking grim. Wash alone raises his hands. The Alliance Commander enters with a number of armed men.)
MAL: Well, quite a lot of fuss. If I didn't know better, I'd think we were dangerous.
HARKEN: Is this your vessel?
MAL: It is, bought and paid for. I'm Captain Malcolm Reynolds.
HARKEN: And is this everyone, Captain?
MAL: By way of crew it is, though in our infirmary you're going to find a fellow that we rescued off that derelict. Saved him, guess you could say.
HARKEN: Hmm.
Unconvinced, Commander Harken motions to his soldiers to check this out.
MAL: Straight through the back, next to the common area.
HARKEN: (re. salvage) And these items, I take it you rescued them as well.
(Quick cut to the infirmary, where two of the soldiers are entering. Off-camera, we hear soft, maniacal laughter. Cut back to the cargo bay.)
HARKEN: Looks to me like an illegal salvage operation.
MAL: Does it? Well, that's discouraging.
HARKEN: Yeah, and Alliance property. You could lose your ship, Captain. But that is a wrist slap compared to the penalty for harboring fugitives. A brother and sister. When I search this vessel, I won't find them, will I?
MAL: No children on this boat.
HARKEN: Hmm. I didn't say "children". Siblings, adult siblings.
MAL: I misunderstood.
HARKEN: No chance they could have stowed away? No one would blame you for that Captain. I know how these older model Fireflys tend to have those troublesome little nooks.
MAL: Do they?
HARKEN: Smugglers and the like tend to prefer them just for that reason.
One of the soldiers that went to the infirmary returns and whispers something into the Commander's ear.
HARKEN: We will continue this conversation in a more official capacity.
The soldiers begin to hustle our crew off Serenity and onto the Alliance ship.
HARKEN: I want every inch of this junker tossed.
KAYLEE: Junker?
MAL: Settle down, Kaylee.
KAYLEE: But Captain, did you hear what that purple-belly called Serenity?
(Quick cut to the infirmary, where soldiers are carrying out the man rescued from the derelict, strapped to a stretcher. Other soldiers are searching Serenity.)

INT. ALLIANCE SHIP - INTERROGATION ROOM
HARKEN: You are a Companion.
The Commander and Inara are seated at a large, glass-topped table in an otherwise empty room.
INARA: Yes.
HARKEN: And you were based for years on Sihnon. It's only in the last year that you've been shipping out with the crew of The Serenity?
INARA: It's just Serenity, and that's correct. In a few weeks, it will be a year.
HARKEN: Oh.
INARA: Why is this important?
HARKEN: I'm just trying to put the pieces together. It's a curiosity, a woman of stature such as yourself falling in with... (beat) ...these types.
INARA: Not in the least. It's a mutually beneficial business arrangement. I rent the shuttle from Captain Reynolds, which allows me to expand my client base. And the Captain finds that having a Companion on board opens certain doors to him that might otherwise be closed to him.
HARKEN: And do you love him?
Cut to see that the Commander is now speaking to Zoe.
ZOE: I don't see how that's relevant.
HARKEN: Well, he is your husband.
ZOE: Yes.
HARKEN: You two met through Captain Reynolds?
ZOE: Captain was looking for a pilot. I found a husband. Seemed to work out.
HARKEN: You fought with Captain Reynolds in the war?
ZOE: Fought with a lot of people in the war.
HARKEN: And your husband?
ZOE: Fight with him sometimes, too.
HARKEN: Is there any particular reason you don't wish to discuss your marriage?
ZOE: Don't see that it's any of your business, is all. We're very private people.
Cut to the Commander now speaking with Wash.
WASH: The legs. Oh yeah, definitely have to say it was her legs. You can put that down. Her legs, and where her legs meet her back. Actually, that whole area. That,and above it.
Quick cut to Kaylee speaking to the Commander. Note that each crewmember is being interviewed separately; they are not in the room at the same time. Interspersed throughout the interrogation scenes are cuts to the soldiers methodically searching Serenity.
KAYLEE: Six Gurtslers crammed under every cooling drive, so that you strain your primary artery function, and you end up having to recycle secondary exhaust through a bypass system, just so's you don't end up pumping it though the main atmo feed and asphyxiating the entire crew! Now that's junk.
Cut back to Wash.
WASH: Have you seen what she wears? Forget about it. Have you ever been with a warrior woman? Cut to Jayne, staring silently at the Commander.
Cut to the Commander interviewing Shepherd Book.
HARKEN: Pirates. Pirates with their own chaplain. There's an oddity.
BOOK: Not the only oddity this end of space, Commander. Way of things not always so plain as on the central planets. Rules can be a mite fuzzier.
HARKEN: These fugitives that we're looking for, the brother and the sister. They were last seen on Persephone.
BOOK: That a fact?
HARKEN: They also left port aboard a Firefly-class transport. Just about the same time you shipped out with Serenity.
BOOK: Well, Persephone's a big place.
HARKEN: Yes, it is, and that Firefly isn't. And if anyone's hiding anywhere on it, we will find them.

EXT. SERENITY
Simon and River are in spacesuits, clinging to the hull of Serenity. River is gazing at the stars, a rapt, wondrous look on her face, and a rare smile. Simon is obviously terrified. He turns to see the look on his sister's face, then looks over his shoulder at the vastness of space. He quickly turns back, his face as near to the hull as he can manage.

INT. ALLIANCE SHIP - INTERROGATION ROOM
The Commander is interviewing Mal. Mal is the only one of the crew that warrants an armed guard, apparently.
MAL: So, by now, I figure you've been over to the derelict. Seen it for yourself.
HARKEN: Yes. Terrible thing.
MAL: You want my advice, you won't tow it back. Just fire the whole gorram thing from space. Be done with it.
HARKEN: That ship is evidence. I'm not in the habit of destroying evidence.
MAL: 'Course not. Be against the rules. I'm going to make a leap here and figure this is your first tour here, out on the border?
HARKEN: That's a very loyal crew you have there. But then I can tell by your record you have a tendency to inspire that quality in people. (beat) Sergeant.
MAL: It's not "Sergeant". Not no more. War's over.
HARKEN: For some the war will never be over. I notice your ship's called Serenity. You were stationed on Hera at the end of the war; Battle of Serenity Valley took place there if I recall.
MAL: You know, I believe you might be right.
HARKEN: Independents suffered a pretty crushing defeat there. Some say that after Serenity the brown coats were through. That the war ended in that valley.
MAL: Hmm.
HARKEN: Seems odd that you would name your ship after a battle you were on the wrong side of.
MAL: May have been the losing side. Still not convinced it was the wrong one.
HARKEN: Is that why you attacked that transport?
MAL: What?
HARKEN: You're still fighting the same battle, Sergeant. Only those weren't soldiers you murdered. Those were civilians, families. Citizens loyal to the Alliance, trying to make a new life for themselves and you just can't stand that, can you?
MAL: So we attacked that ship, then brought the only living survivor to our infirmary. That's what we did?
HARKEN: I'd ask him. Only I'm not sure he'll be able to speak with his tongue split down the middle.
MAL: (realizing) [Wuh de tyen, ah. - "Dear god in heaven."]
HARKEN: I haven't seen that kind of torture since... well, since the war.
MAL: (quietly, to himself) Oh I should have known.
HARKEN: You and your crew are bound by law. Formal charges will be transmitted to Central Authority.
MAL: Commander, I'm not what you need to be concerned with right now. Things go the way they are, there's going to be blood.

INT. ALLIANCE SHIP - INFIRMARY
Several doctors and nurses are working on the man from the derelict. He seems to be convulsing on the table.
DOCTOR: Get a line in! The staff is working frantically, at first it seems they are trying to revive the man, but then it becomes clear they are trying to restrain him. We see the man's hand come up, holding the long, slim knife he grabbed while on Serenity. There is screaming and a stream of blood splashes onto the wall.

BLACK OUT.


INT. ALLIANCE SHIP - INTERROGATION ROOM
Mal's been telling his story. Harken's not buying it.
HARKEN: Reavers?
MAL: That is what I said.
HARKEN: You can't imagine how many times men in my position hear that excuse. "Reavers did it."
MAL: It's the truth.
HARKEN: You saw them, did you?
MAL: Wouldn't be sitting here talking to you if I had.
HARKEN: No, of course not.
MAL: But I'll tell you who did. That poor bastard you took off my ship. He looked right into the face of it. Was made to stare. 
HARKEN: "It"?
MAL: The darkness. Kind of darkness you can't even imagine. Blacker than the space it moves through.
HARKEN: Very poetic.
MAL: They made him watch. He probably tried to turn away, and they wouldn't let him. You call him a survivor? He's not. A man comes up against that kind of will, the only way to deal with it, I suspect, is to become it. He's following the only course left to him. First, he'll try to make himself look like one. Cut on himself, desecrate his flesh and then, he'll start acting like one.
The Commander taps an intercom buzzer, and a second armed soldier enters.
HARKEN: Let's have two M.P.s up here to escort Sergeant Reynolds to the brig.

INT. SERENITY - AIRLOCK
Simon and River have come inside, and are removing their spacesuits.
RIVER: Let's go again.
SIMON: Later, maybe. Captain said once the coast is clear, we should lay low in the shuttle. Come on.
RIVER: (sensing something) He's coming back.
SIMON: (misunderstanding) Yes, yes of course he is. They all are.

INT. ALLIANCE SHIP - INTERROGATION ROOM
Two M.P.s are taking Mal to the brig.
HARKEN: Your ship and its contents will be auctioned, the proceeds of the sale will be applied to the cost of your defense. A third soldier enters and whispers into the Commander's ear.
HARKEN: (re: Mal) Get him out of here! 
HARKEN: (to the third soldier) Go to full lock-down. I want guards on the nursery.
MAL: It won't matter! You won't find him. But I know where he'll go.

INT. SERENITY - GALLEY
The place is a mess, torn apart by the soldiers. Simon and River enter, still wearing the spacesuits.
RIVER: Wait, no! Don't, don't.
SIMON: No, River, River, it's okay.
River refuses to enter the galley, despite Simon's assurances.
RIVER: Wait, wait wait wait.
SIMON: They've gone. Come on.
RIVER: Don't...
SIMON: It's okay, come on.
From off-screen, we see a hand slip into frame and take a knife from a table.
RIVER: No, don't!
SIMON: River, you don't have to be afraid.

INT. ALLIANCE SHIP - CORRIDOR LEADING TO SERENITY
A man lies bloody and quite dead on the floor. The Commander and four soldiers are with Mal, who is handcuffed with his hands behind his back.
HARKEN: Why would he come back here?
MAL: Looking for familiar ground. He's on the hunt.
HARKEN: (re: Mal) All right, let's get him to the brig.
MAL: No, no, no... whoa, I should go with you.
HARKEN: That's out of the question.
MAL: How many more men do you feel like losing today, Commander? Nobody knows Serenity like I do. I can help you.
HARKEN: (considers briefly, then nods) We let him go first.
MAL: Right. You want to, uh?
Mal motions with his handcuffs. The Commander unlocks the handcuffs, and re-fastens them, only this time Mal has his hands in front of himself.
MAL: Thanks. Now I'll really have the advantage.

INT. SERENITY - GALLEY
River still refuses to go into the galley.
SIMON: No, we don't, we don't know how long it's going to be. Once we're settled, I don't think we should move around much. I'm just going to grab some food.
Simon hears footsteps.
SIMON: Someone's coming.
Mal enters the galley warily, with the Commander and other soldiers following. He crosses the length of the galley, and notices a Simon's helmet in the passage at the other end. He steps into the doorway, where he sees Simon and River pressed up against the wall. Just at that moment, the man rescued from the derelict attacks one of the soldiers. A spatter of blood hits the Commander in the face. The Commander is then knocked to the ground by the Survivor, and we see the Survivor's face has been inexpertly pierced by what looks like surgical staples, bloody and horrifying. As he closes in for the kill, Mal loops his handcuffed hands around the neck of the attacker, and throttles him to death.

EXT. SPACE
Serenity undocks from Alliance ship and begins maneuvering for departure.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Wash, Zoe, Mal and Jayne are looking out of the bridge viewports.

JAYNE: (pensively) You saved his gorram life he still takes the cargo. [Hwoon dahn. - "Jerk."]
MAL: He had to... (shakes head) Couldn't let us profit. (beat) Wouldn't be civilized.

EXT. SPACE
(Shot of Alliance ship firing missiles to destroy the derelict ship. We watch as ship slowly explodes and breaks up.)

BLACK OUT.


INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT
Mal and Jayne are playing pool with a guy named Wright, while Inara sits at the bar and sips a dainty pink drink.
WRIGHT: Didn't hardly have to convert the ship even. Six in the corner. Stronger locks, thicker doors, keep everybody where they're supposed to be. Don't even need more rations.
Pool balls on table waver and nearly disappear, like a holographic image shorting out.
WRIGHT: (in Chinese) [Way! - "Hey!"]
A bar worker motions to the wall.
(Cut to a shot of a sign on the wall "MANAGEMENT NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BALL FAILURE".)
JAYNE: You made money, huh?
WRIGHT: Hand over fist, my friend. Water planets need labor, terraforming crews got a prodigious death rate.
MAL: Labor, you mean, uh ... slaves.
WRIGHT: Well it wasn't volunteers, for damn sure.
MAL: That why you didn't have to lay in more rations?
WRIGHT: I didn't hear no complaints.
JAYNE: How much money, lots?
Mal walks over to Inara, who's been watching the game from the bar.
MAL: There's a chance you might want to head back to the ship.
INARA: Oh, I'm all right. This is entertaining, actually.
MAL: Yeah? What's entertaining?
INARA: I like watching the game. As with other situations, the key seems to be giving Jayne a heavy stick and standing back.
MAL: Still, might ought to clear out before too much longer. Seems there's a thief about.
INARA: A thief?
MAL: Took this right off him. 
MAL: (Mal hands Inara a wad of cash.) Now they earned that with the sweat of their slave-trading brows.
INARA: (hushed and a bit shocked) Mal...
Inara shoves the cash into her bra.
MAL: Aw, terrible shame. Course they won't discover it till they go order their next round of drinks.
Hand comes from behind and grabs Mal's shoulder.
WRIGHT: (in Chinese) [Way! - "Hey!"]
MAL: Good drinker, that one.
Mal turns and slugs the grabber square in the jaw. Raucous bar fight ensues, Mal and Jayne basically kicking ass, while Inara stays out of the way and looks on. Bad guys down, if not beaten, Mal takes Inara's arm and hustles her out.
INARA: Lovely place, I'll tell my friends.


INT. SERENTIY - BRIDGE
Wash is piloting the ship while Zoe looks out the front port.
WASH: Seem to you we cleared out of Santo in a hurry?
ZOE: Seems we do that a lot. Heard tell though, we're going to stay a while on Persephone.
WASH: Shiny.
ZOE: Yeah? Thought you'd get land crazy that long in port.
WASH: Probably, but I've been sane a long while now, and change is good.
Mal enters the bridge.
MAL: Well, ain't that a joyful sight?
WASH: Gotta love a sunset.
ZOE: Starting to get familiar too, like a second home.
MAL: Persephone ain't home. Too many people we got to avoid. Re-supply, look for work, move along. Sniff the air, we don't kiss the dirt.
ZOE: Wasn't planning on the dirt-kissing, sir.
WASH: Besides, I wouldn't stand for it anyway, Captain, jealous man like me.
WASH: (re: alarm sounding from the console) Closing in.
ZOE: Planet's coming up a mite fast.
WASH: That's just cause, I'm going down too quick. Likely crash and kill us all.
MAL: Well, that happens, let me know.
Mal walks off the bridge.
WASH: (maybe a tad nervous) Okay. Whoa. No, we're good, we're good. It's okay.

INT. - INARA'S SHUTTLE
(Cut to a computer screen with several faces displayed. Inara deletes a few faces, and then selects one which enlarges and begins speaking. The face belongs to a well-dressed but awkward young man.)
YOUNGER_HOPEFUL: I understand your time on our planet is limited, and if you've selected my proposal to hear, then the honor you do me flatters.... my honor....and I hope that...
Inara cuts off the recitation and selects another face. While the previous young man's speech seemed pre-recorded, this is clearly a live transmission.
ATHERTON: Now there's the smile made of sunlight.
INARA: Atherton, how wonderful to see you.
ATHERTON: Did you get my message? I was extra appealing.
INARA: What a flattering invitation. I had no idea I was arriving in time for the social event of the season.
ATHERTON: So, you'll accompany me? I ask, heart in my throat. There's a certain offer I'm still waiting to hear about.
Off-screen knocking at the door.
INARA: Yes, I imagine there is. I'm delighted to say I'll be there. Now, I'm sorry Atherton, but I have to run.
ATHERTON: No, please, I understand. I'll see you soon, [bao bay - "sweetheart"].
Mal enters Inara's shuttle.
INARA: Good afternoon, Captain.
MAL: Morning. We're downing, and in case that Wash don't kill us all, local time's going to be in the a.m., 10 or so.
INARA: Yes, I saw that.
MAL: (looking over Inara's shoulder, which still shows the face of Atherton) Making plans? "Atherton Wing". He's a regular, ain't he?
Inara covers the computer screen with a handy drapery.
INARA: I've seen him before.
MAL: Oh, I never did. Not what I pictured - young. Must be rich too, to afford your rates.
INARA: I suppose. He has engaged me for several days.
MAL: Days!? Boy must have stamina.
INARA: He does.
MAL: Well...fine. Is he letting you out at all?
INARA: Actually, we're attending a ball tomorrow night.
MAL: Tell me, do all the men there pay for their dates, or just the young rich ones with stamina?
INARA: Most of the women in there will not be Companions, if that's what you're sking. Perhaps the other men couldn't attract one.
MAL: Hmm. It's sounds like the finest party I can imagine getting paid to go to.
INARA: I don't suppose you'd find it up to standards of your outings. More conversation and somewhat less petty theft and getting hit with pool cues. I understand if you need to go prepare for that "It's 10 in the morning" issue.
MAL: Yeah. Better go do that. 'Cause I think this is more of an evening look.

EXT. PERSEPHONE MOON - BUSY STREET SCENE - DAY
Kaylee, Zoe, Wash, Mal and Jayne are walking through a street, carrying luggage. Kaylee spies a shop window and moves in for a closer look. The others follow.
KAYLEE: Oh, look at the pretties!
WASH: What am I looking at, the girls or the clothes?
JAYNE: There's clothes?
ZOE: The clothes, please.
KAYLEE: (indicating a pink frilly dress, something out of Gone With the Wind) Say, look at the fluffy one.
ZOE: Too much foofaraw. If I'm going to wear a dress, I'd want something with some slink.
WASH: (eagerly) You want a slinky dress? I can buy you a slinky dress. Captain, can I have money for a slinky dress?
JAYNE: I'll chip in.
ZOE: (to Jayne) I can hurt you.
KAYLEE: The only place I seen somethin' so nice is some of the things Inara has.
MAL: Well, we best be movin'.
ZOE: (to Kaylee) I guess she needs all that stuff, the life she leads.
KAYLEE: Well, sure. Sometimes the customers buy her things. Some real rich men.
MAL: Come on! These ain't feathers I'm toting here, ya know?
KAYLEE: I like the ruffles. Inara gets to wear whatever she wants.
MAL: What are you going to do in that rig? Flounce around the engine room? Be like a sheep walking on its hind legs.
Kaylee walks off, obviously hurt. Zoe gives Mal a glare.
ZOE: See ya on the ship, Captain.
Mal looks disgusted with himself.
Zoe, Wash and Kaylee board a quad-runner type thing and leave.
JAYNE: (to Mal) Is she mad or something?
Off screen sound of gun cocking. Mal turns to see a dread-locked man holding a rifle on him. We see at least one more thug with a rifle at the ready. A small man in a derby approaches from the side.
MAL: Badger.
BADGER: (noticeable cockney accent) Captain Reynolds. Heard you was in town. Thought we might have a bit of a sit-down.
MAL: Prefer a bit of a piss-off.
BADGER: I'm very sorry. Did I give you the impression I was asking?

INT. - BADGER'S OFFICE - DAY
Jayne, Mal and Badger are seated around what is possibly a crate, passing for a table.
MAL: Seems the last time there was a chance for a little palaver we were all manner of unwelcome.
JAYNE: (sipping from a chipped tea cup) This ain't bad.
BADGER: There's a trick to it: wood-alcohol.
MAL: Now we're favored guests... treated to the finest in beverages that make you blind. So what is it you need?
JAYNE: (mouth full as he reaches for more sandwiches that are laid out on the table) Mmm, 'scuse me.
BADGER: There's a local, but the name of Warrick Harrow. Got some property he wants to sell off-planet... fetch a high price.
MAL: The local powers won't let him sell off-world.
BADGER: It's a conundrum. What my man Harrow needs himself is a smuggler. Willing to cut you in on it.
MAL: Why me? You have access to ships. You could do it yourself.
BADGER: He won't deal with me direct. He's taken an irrational dislike.
JAYNE: What happened? He see your face?
BADGER: He's a quality gent. Nose in the air like he never [wun gwo pee - "smelled a fart"]. Don't find me respectable. But you, now I figure you got a chance.
MAL: You backed out of a deal last time. Left us hanging.
JAYNE: Hurt our feelings.
MAL: You recall why that took place?
BADGER: Had a problem with your attitude is why. Felt you was... what's the word?
JAYNE: Pretentious?
Mal looks at Jayne as if he's surprised to learn Jayne knows a word with that many syllables.
BADGER: Exactly! You think you're better than other people.
MAL: Just the ones I'm better than. And that very quality is the one I think you're placing value on today.
BADGER: I'm placing value on the fact that stick up your [pee goo - "bottom"] is about as large as the one Harrow's got.
MAL: How would you set up a meet, man that won't deal with you?
BADGER: I know a place he'll be. Safe place. Using some new-tech gun scans. High-class too. Wouldn't let me in there. You might slip in. Course you couldn't buy an invite with a diamond the size of a testicle, but I got my hands on a couple.
Mal and Jayne glance at each other, snickering like little boys.
BADGER: Of invites! You want this meeting or not?

INT. - GRAND BALLROOM ENTRANCE WAY - NIGHT
There is a porter announcing guests as they arrive.
PORTER: Colonel Cyrus Momsen, and escort.
PORTER: (beat) William and Lady Cortland.
A translucent grid appears, Cortland hands over a small handgun to a waiting security guard.
PORTER: Atherton Wing, and Inara Serra.
Inara and Atherton enter the ballroom, with is terribly genteel and stylish, people are dancing in a very courtly fashion.
INARA: (to a woman standing off to one side) Roberta, its been too long.
INARA: (to an older man seated and sipping a glass
of red wine, in Chinese) [Lao pung yo, nee can chi lai hun yo jing shen. - "You're looking wonderful, old friend."]
ATHERTON: Half the men in this room wish you were on their arm, tonight.
INARA: Only half? I must be losing my indefinable allure.
ATHERTON: Oh, its not that indefinable.
ATHERTON: (quietly) All of them wish they were in your bed.
INARA: (seems a bit put off by that remark) I'm looking for the boy with the shimmerwine.
ATHERTON: Oh, she blushes. Not many in your line of work do that. You are a very singular woman. And I find.... I find I admire you more and more.

INT. SERENITY - ENGINE ROOM
Kaylee is working on something mechanical. Mal enters.
MAL: Kaylee? Kaylee!
KAYLEE: I'm not speaking to you, Captain.
MAL: Got no need to speak. Come on. Got a job for you.
Kaylee mutters under her breath.

INT. - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT
Atherton and Inara are dancing together.
ATHERTON: I'm trying to offer you something you know. A life.
INARA: Atherton...
ATHERTON: You can live here on Persephone, as my personal companion.
INARA: You are a generous man.
ATHERTON: That is not a "yes".
INARA: It's not a "no", either.
INARA: (to a woman dancing nearby) You look gorgeous, dear.
ATHERTON: You belong here, Inara, not on that flying piece of [gos se. - "crap."] You see that, don't you?
INARA: Atherton, language.
ATHERTON: What? Piece of [gos se? - "crap?"] But it is a piece of [gos se. - "crap."]
PORTER: Miss Kaywinnit Lee Frye and escort.
INARA: (turns and looks toward the entrance) Kaylee?
Mal and Kaylee enter the ballroom, Kaylee looking radiant in the ruffly pink hoop skirted dress she was admiring in the shop window.
INARA: Oh, [gos se. - "crap."]


INT. GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT
Right back where we left off, with Kaylee and Mal wandering farther into the ballroom.
MAL: Does.. um.. does this seem kind of tight?
KAYLEE: Shows off your backside. Did you see the chandelier? It's hovering!
MAL: What's the point of that, I wonder?
KAYLEE: Oh! Mangoes!
MAL: I mean, I see how they did it. I just ain't getting the why.
KAYLEE: These girls have the most beautiful dresses. And so do I -- how about that?
MAL: Yeah, well, just be careful. We cheated Badger out of good money to buy that frippery, and you're supposed to make me look respectable.
KAYLEE: Yes, sir, Captain Tightpants.
MAL: Ok, I'm looking for our guy Harrow.
KAYLEE: And Inara. We should look for Inara, right? Just to say halloo at her.
MAL: If we see her. I think she's wearing gold. Okay, help me find our man. He's supposed to be old, kinda stocky, wears a red sash crossways.
KAYLEE: Why does he do that?
MAL: Maybe he won the Miss Persephone Pageant. Just help me look.
KAYLEE: Is that him?
MAL: That's the buffet table.
KAYLEE: Well how can we be sure, unless we question it?
MAL: Fine. Don't make yourself sick.
KAYLEE: Oh, [sheh-sheh - "thank you"], Captain.

INT. SERENITY - COMMON AREA
Jayne, Simon and Book are playing cards. River is skulking around in the background. The boys have scraps of paper instead of chips. They seem to be playing for ship-board chores.
SIMON: (dealing) Ante up, gentlemen. Dishes.
BOOK: Dishes. Could do with less of them.
JAYNE: Garbage.
SIMON: (turns over a card) Tall card... plum. Plums are tall.
BOOK: I'll take... two.
SIMON: Two. No tall card claim.
JAYNE: Speaking of garbage, I'll take three.
SIMON: Three. Dealer forced to claim the tall.
In the background, River is muttering over cans of food, getting increasingly more agitated.
BOOK: What do you supposed the Captain and Kaylee are doing now? Septic vat.
JAYNE: Eating steaks off of plates made of solid money, like as anything. I fold.
River is now ripping the labels from several cans of food.
SIMON: Me too. Tall card's around my neck like a weight. Take it Shepherd.
BOOK: That's a nice pile of things I don't have to do.
RIVER: (still attacking the food packages) These are the ones that take you. They're the ones reaching and doing. They're the ones...
The three at the table finally notice River. Book and Simon move to her side.
SIMON: River.
BOOK: Is she hurt?
JAYNE: You better see to her. Bad habit for a fugitive. She's going to do that in public and get herself hauled off.
As Jayne is saying this, he is re-arranging the scraps of paper that represent winnings in the card game, while Simon and Book are busy tending to freaking-out River.
RIVER: ...everywhere... and the hands go everywhere...
SIMON: (gently restraining her) Shhh, its ok.
RIVER: ...when you brush your teeth and...
BOOK: It's ok, she didn't harm much.
RIVER: ...and nobody said anything....
BOOK: We'll have a few mystery meals.
SIMON: It's ok. Shh shh shh shh.
RIVER: (calmer now) ...and then they come.
JAYNE: So we gonna play cards, or screw around?

INT. SERENITY - ZOE AND WASH'S PERSONAL QUARTERS
(Cut to a long, lovely shot, traveling up Zoe's naked leg. Zoe and Wash are in bed, obviously in the throes of post-coital bliss. Both are breathless. The atmosphere is comfortable and happy. These people are deeply in love with one another.)
ZOE: I thought you wanted to spend more time off-ship this visit.
WASH: Out there is seems like its all fancy parties. I like our party better. The dress code is easier and I know all the steps.
ZOE: (happy and sleepy) I'd say you do at that.
WASH: Don't fall asleep now. Sleepiness is weakness of character. Ask anyone. You're acting captain. Know what happens you fall asleep now?
ZOE: Jayne slits my throat and takes over.
WASH: That's right.
ZOE: And we can't stop it.
WASH: Well, I wash my hands of it. It's a hopeless case. I'll read a nice poem at the funeral. Something with imagery.
ZOE: You could lock the door and keep the power-hungry maniac at bay.
WASH: Oh, no, I'm starting to like this poetry idea now. (dramatically) "Here lies my beloved Zoe, my autumn flower, somewhat less attractive now she's all corpsified and gross..."
Zoe ends this eulogy with a pillow to Wash's face.

INT. GRAND BALLROOM - PROBABLY NIGHT
KAYLEE: (watching the dancing, to a young gentleman standing on the edge of the dance floor) Aren't they something. They're like butterflies, or little pieces of wrapping paper blowing around. The young gentleman bows and walks off, leaving Kaylee. She looks a little sad, bur rallies and walks over to a group of women.
KAYLEE: Hello.
BANNING: I don't.. um... have we been introduced?
KAYLEE: (shaking hands with first woman) Oh, I'm Kaylee.
BANNING: Banning. And this is Destra, Cabott and Zelle.
KAYLEE: (gushing) Don't you just love this party? Everything's so fancy, and there's some kind of hot cheese over there.
CABOTT: It's not as good as last year.
KAYLEE: Oh really? What'd they have last year?
CABOTT: Standards.
Kaylee looks crestfallen.
BANNING: Who made your dress, Kaylee?
KAYLEE: Oh, do you like it? When I saw the ruffles, I just couldn't resist.
BANNING: You ought to see to your girl.
KAYLEE: [Shah muh? - "What?"]
BANNING: Your girl. She's not very good. She made you a dress that looks like you bought it in a store.
KAYLEE: Oh, I didn't know.
An older gentleman has obviously overheard this exchange, and walks to Kaylee's side.
MURPHY: Why Banning Miller. What a vision you are in your fine dress. It must have taken a dozen slaves a dozen days to get you into that getup.
(Banning preens)
MURPHY: 'Course your daddy tells me it takes the space of a schoolboy's wink to get you out of it again. Banning gets huffy and stalks off, followed by the other women. Kaylee looks surprised and delighted.
MURPHY: Forgive my rudeness. I cannot abide useless people. Cut to Mal, as he spies his quarry. He crosses over to Harrow. 
HARROW: (to someone offscreen) Oh, no, thank you very much.
MAL: Beg pardon, but would you be Warrick Harrow?
HARROW: Sir Warrick Harrow. The sash.
MAL: The sash.
HARROW: It indicates lordship.
MAL: And it's... it's doing a great job.
Harrow sighs and moves away.
MAL: Sir, my name is Malcolm Reynolds. I captain a ship, name of Serenity. I mention this because I've been led to believe you want to move some property off-world.
MAL: (tto see Inara dancing with Atherton, then turns back to Harrow) Some property you want to move off-world discreetly. 
HARROW: You're mistaken sir. I'm an honest man.
MAL: It seems to me there's nothing dishonest to getting your goods to people what need them.
HARROW: Whom do you represent?
MAL: "Represent" isn't exactly the...
HARROW: Don't waste my time.
MAL: Fellow called Badger.
HARROW: I know him. And I think he's a psychotic low-life.
MAL: And I think calling him that is an insult to the psychotic low-life community. But the deal is solid.
Atherton and Inara walk up.
ATHERTON: Sorry to interrupt, Sir Warrick, I know you from the club, I believe.
INARA: Captain, this is Atherton Wing, Atherton, this is Captain Mal Reynolds.
MAL: Pleased to meet ya. Inara, I didn't realize you were going to this party.
INARA: It's the only party.
MAL: And I can see why. How about that floating chandelier?
MAL: (to Atherton) Almost outshines our girl here.
Mal notices the possessive and overly rough grip Atherton has on Inara's upper arm.
MAL: Ath? Can I call you Ath? Inara has spoken of you to me. She made a point of mentioning your generosity. Given that, I'm sure you won't mind if I ask Inara the favor of a dance?
ATHERTON: (not happy) Of course.
Inara and Mal walk off.
HARROW: (to Atherton) You're a brave man.
ATHERTON: I know what's mine.
Mal leads Inara to the dance floor.
MAL: This dance I think I actually know.
INARA: Why are you here?
MAL: Business. Same as you. I was talking to a contact about a smuggling job and you came over to me.
INARA: You were staring at me.
MAL: I saw you is all. You stand out.
INARA: In this company, Captain, I believe you're the one who stands out.
MAL: Well then, maybe I just wanted to see a professional at work. Is this the hardest part, would you say, or does that come later?
INARA: You have no call to try to make me ashamed of my job. What I do is legal. And how's that smuggling coming?
MAL: My work's illegal, but at least it's honest.
INARA: What!?
MAL: Well this, the lie of it. That man parading you around on his arm as if he actually won you, as if he loves you, and everyone here actually going along with it.
INARA: These people like me and I like them. I like Atherton too by the way.
MAL: Well sure, what's not to like. I'm liable to sleep with him myself.
INARA: And he likes me, whether you see it or not. He's made me an offer. You may think he doesn't honor me, but he wants me to live here. I'd be his personal companion. I could belong here. Call me pretentious but there is some appeal in that.
MAL: You're right. Got no call to stop you. You've got the right to a decent life.
INARA: I see Kaylee's here.
MAL: Yeah, crying Cinderella tears. You should have seen her when I told he she could have that layer cake she's wearing.
INARA: I think she looks adorable.
MAL: Yeah, but I never said it.
(Cut to scene of Kaylee, holding court with a group of mostly older men, including her rescuer.)
KAYLEE: I'm not saying the 80-04's hard to repair, it just ain't worth it.
OLDER_FARMER: It's a fine machine, you just keep it tuned.
KAYLEE: [Tsai boo shr. - "No way."] The extenders ain't braced.
MURPHY: I've been telling him to buy the 80-10 for years.
KAYLEE: Those 'tenders snap off, don't matter how good the engine's cycling.
YOUNGER_FARMER: Miss Kaylee, I wonder if I could request the honor of....
MURPHY: (interrupting) Wait a minute. Let her talk. She's talking. Dance later.
KAYLEE: By the way, the 80-10's the same machine, they just changed the plating and hope no one noticed.
The men laugh, obviously charmed by Kaylee.
(Cut back to Mal and Inara dancing, while Atherton looks on with a glare. Mal missteps the dance, and Inara and Mal both chuckle.)
MAL: It's possible you were right, and this ain't my kind of party.
They are comfortable with each other, laughing and smiling. Atherton barges in and roughly grabs Inara's arm and pulls her away from the dance floor.
MAL: Whoa now. Watch yourself. Ain't no need for hands on.
ATHERTON: Excuse me, she's not here with you, Captain. She's mine.
MAL: Yours? She don't belong to nobody.
ATHERTON: Money changed hands, which makes her mine tonight. And no matter how you dress her up she's still...
Mal hauls off and slugs him before he can get the rest of the sentence out.
MAL: (to Inara) Turns out this is my kind of party.
INARA: Oh, Mal.
MAL: What? Man was out of line.
ATHERTON: (recovering, angry) I accept.
MAL: That's great. What?
GENTLEMAN: There has been a challenge.
ATHERTON: I hope you're prepared, Captain.
MAL: What? You all talking about a fight? That's fine. (taking off his jacket) Let's get out of here.
INARA: It's not a fist fight, Mal.
GENTLEMAN: The duel will be met tomorrow morning at Cadrie Pond.
MAL: Well, why wait? Where's that guard? He collected a whole mess of pistols.
GENTLEMAN: If you require it, any gentleman here can give you use of a sword.
MAL: Use of a swo... what?


INT. GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT
Back where we left off, Mal in hot water:
KAYLEE: What's going on?
MAL: I'm not rightly sure. What's going on?
HARROW: First off, you'll be put up in lodgings for the night, so you don't disappear. I wouldn't blame you, incidentally. Wing may be a spoiled dandy, but he's an expert swordsman. He's killed a dozen men with a longblade. You're the only one gave him a reason.
MAL: (exasperated) Oh this is a joke.
INARA: He'll need a second.
MAL: What's that?
HARROW: I'll take on the job.
INARA: He fights if you refuse.
ATHERTON: (moving towards the entranceway) Inara, come with me, please.
MAL: (to Harrow) You taking on this job... being my second... does this mean we're in business?
HARROW: It means you're in mortal danger. But you mussed up Atherton's face, and that has endeared you to me somewhat. You might even give him a fight, before he guts you.
ATHERTON: (sharply) Inara! 
(holds out his arm to Inara)
KAYLEE: Up until the punching, it was a real nice party.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO HOLD
Jayne is doing pull-ups from straps attached to the overhead walkway. There is a banging noise, like someone knocking on a metal door. Jayne stops, picks up a rifle, and looks out the small window of a door. Sighs, and opens the door to admit Badger.
BADGER: The captain's gone and gotten himself in trouble.
A short time later, the crew has assembled in the cargo hold. Only Jayne and River are missing.
BOOK: A duel?
WASH: With swords?
SIMON: Captain's a good fighter, he must know how to handle a sword.
ZOE: I think he knows which end to hold.
SIMON: All right, so we just need to figure out how to get him out of there.
BOOK: (to Badger) We have until the morning, correct? Do you know what lodging he's in?
BADGER: This is embarrassing. Some of you seem to be misapprehending my purpose in being here.
ZOE: You're here to make sure that we don't do what these men are keen on doing.
BADGER: Penny for the smart lady. Persephone's my home. I got to do business with the people here. I don't want it known I brought someone in caused this kind of ruckus. We'll just settle in, till this blows over, one way or the other.
Off-camera sound of rifle being cocked. Heads turn to look up onto the overhead walkway. Jayne holds his rifle on Badger. Zoe smiles.
ZOE: Jayne, I wouldn't.
JAYNE: Why not?
Zoe indicates to where Badger's thugs have just come in with Kaylee. She's still in her party dress, and looks unhappy.
KAYLEE: Hi.

INT. LARGE MANSION - NIGHT
Inara is walking through the halls. She affixes a glowy door-handle sort of thing to one of the many doors, and walks in to find Mal practicing with a sword.
INARA: Mal?
MAL: (startled and swinging his sword into a pillar, where it lodges) Whoa! What are you doing here?
INARA: Atherton's a heavy sleeper the night before a big day. He's got that killing in the morning, and a haircut later.
MAL: Such a comfort, having friends visit at a time like this.
INARA: I knew the accommodations would be nice. Atherton doesn't skimp.
Mal pulls the sword from the pillar.
MAL: I don't suppose I like being kept by him as much as others do. So, how come you're still attached to him?
INARA: Because it's my decision, not yours.
MAL: I thought he made it pretty clear he has no regard for you.
INARA: You did manage to push him into saying something, yes. Made a nice justification for the punch.
MAL: Well, he insulted you. I hit him. Seemed like the thing to do. Why'd this get so complicated?
INARA: Well, it's about to get simpler. There's a back door. Desk clerk is on alert. He'll let us out.
MAL: Whoa, whoa, I'm not running off. I don't know what you got in your head, but I didn't do this to prove some kind of point to you. I thought I was defending your honor. And I never back down from a fight.
INARA: Yes, you do! You do all the time!
MAL: Well, yeah... but, I'm not backing down from this one.
INARA: He's an expert swordsman, Mal. You had trouble with the pillar. How will your death help my honor?
MAL: Well, see, I plan on having it be his death. That's why I need lessons. I figure you know how, being such an educated woman, and all.
(tosses a sword to Inara)

INT. SERENITY - CARGO HOLD
Most of the crew is gathered playing cards. All speak quietly. Badger and his henchman are standing about, mostly doing nothing but looking vaguely threatening. Badger is busy slicing up and eating an apple.
KAYLEE: He said not to do anything. He'll join us after he wins the duel.
ZOE: It doesn't hurt to have a contingency plan, Kaylee.
SIMON: I'm thinking, since we're unarmed, we should take them by surprise.
ZOE: Not necessarily. We can lure one or two of them away. Say infirmary? Take 'em out, be on Badger before he knows what happens.
JAYNE: Only if his attention's elsewhere. What we need's a diversion. I say Zoe gets nekkid.
WASH: (sitting on the floor, head on knees) Nope.
JAYNE: I could get nekkid.
ALL: No!
Book has been standing off to one side during this exchange, reading the Bible. He notices that River has come quietly into the room, and moves to Simon's side and lays a hand on his shoulder. Our crew realizes she's there, and senses that this could be trouble. Simon moves to her. Badger seems not to notice.
SIMON: (whispering) River, you can't be here.
RIVER: (laughing and trying to push by Simon) There are tiny...
SIMON: River, please.
RIVER: Pull!
BADGER: (finally noticing River) Who's that then? Here, look at me. What's your story, love?
SIMON: She's ... just a... just a passenger.
BADGER: Yeah? Why ain't she talking? She got a secret?
RIVER: (with Badger's accent) Sure, I got a secret. More than one. Don't seem likely I'd tell 'em to you now, do it? Anyone off Dyton Colony knows better than to talk to strangers.
RIVER: (notices a shiny pin in the shape of a bird on Badger's lapel, nearly touches it, then runs a finger down his lapel before pulling back) You're talking loud enough for the both of us though, ain'tcha? I've known a dozen like you. Skipped off home early, running graft jobs here and there. Spent some time in the lock down, but less than you claim. And you're what? Petty thief with delusions of standing? Sad, little king of a sad, little hill.
The crew exchanges glances, bemused. Who knew she could pull this off?
BADGER: Nice to see someone from the old homestead.
RIVER: Not really. 
RIVER: (to Simon) Call me if anyone interesting shows up.
River leaves the way she came in.
BADGER: I like her.
JAYNE: (quietly, to the crew) That there -- exactly the kind of diversion we could have used.

INT. MANSION - MAL'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
MAL AND INARA square off, swords in hand.
INARA: Attack.
Mal lunges at Inara with his sword. She easily side-steps him, and whacks him on the ass with her sword as he goes by.
INARA: How did I avoid that?
MAL: By being fast like a freak?
INARA: No, because you always attack the same way, swinging from the shoulder like you were chopping wood. You have to thrust with the point sometimes, or swing from the elbow.
MAL: Swinging from the shoulder feels stronger.
INARA: It's also slower, Mal. You don't need strength as much as speed. We're fragile creatures. It takes less than a pound of pressure to cut skin.
MAL: You know that? They teach you that in whore academy?
INARA: You have a strange sense of nobility Captain. You'll lay a man out for calling me a whore, and yet you keep calling me one to my face.
MAL: I might not show respect to your job, but he didn't respect you. That's the difference. Inara, he doesn't even see you.
INARA: Well I guess death will solve the issue to everyone's satisfaction.
MAL: This [yu bun duh - "stupid"] duel is the result of the rules of your society, not mine.
INARA: You are always breaking the rules, no matter what society you're in! You don't get along with ordinary criminals either, which is why you're constantly getting in trouble.
MAL: You think following the rules will buy you a nice life, even if the rules make you a slave.
MAL: (Inara turns away) Don't take his offer.
INARA: (turning to face Mal) What?
MAL: Don't do it. Because in the case it happens it means he's the fella that killed me and I don't like fellas that kill me, just in general. I said before I don't have call to stop you, and that's true, but anyways, don't.
INARA: I need to get back. He'll be up early.
MAL: Right. He's got that big day.

EXT. PERSEPHONE MOON - CADRIE POND - DAY
There are many on-lookers, including Inara and Harrow. The duelists face off and begin parrying. Mal gets a lucky swipe and draws first blood, with a shallow cut to Atherton's chest.
MAL: (pleased) Best be careful, Ath. Hear these things are sharp.
HARROW: (incredulous, to Inara) He thinks he's doing well, doesn't he?
INARA: (horrified) He's being toyed with.
More dueling, Atherton slashes a shallow cut to Mal's sword arm. Mal attacks rather blindly, flailing his sword broadly from the shoulder. He's obviously out-classed here. Atherton smiles, steps back, and puts both arms behind his back, leaving his chest exposed.
HARROW: What's he doing?
INARA: Don't fall for that!
Mal attacks, and Atherton spins and stabs Mal in the abdomen. This is a serious wound, but not a killing blow.
HARROW: Well, this isn't going to take long, is it?


EXT. PERSEPHONE MOON - CADRIE POND - DAY
Mal is bloodied, and a bit wobbly on his feet. He continues to fight, though with his free hand clamped over his wound. Atherton is gleeful and poised, supremely confident.
HARROW: (to Inara) We're coming up on the end, Miss. You might not want to watch. Harrow is right, this is almost over. Atherton knocks Mal to his knees, and snaps his sword blade off at the hilt. He stands triumphant over Mal, sword at his throat.
INARA: (moving forward) Atherton, wait! I'll stay here, exclusive to you. Just let him live.
Atherton is distracted by Inara, and looks her way. Mal takes his chance then, and knocks Atherton's sword out of his hands, and clubs him across the jaw with the hilt of the broken sword. He quickly kicks up the freed sword and throws it at Atherton, stabbing him through the chest. Atherton manages to pull out the blade, just has Mal clubs him across the face again. Mal picks up the bloody sword, and holds it to the throat of the fallen Atherton.
HARROW: He's down. You have to finish it, lad. You have to finish it. For a man to lie beaten, and yet breathing? It makes him a coward.
INARA: It's humiliation.
MAL: Sure, it's humiliating. Having to lie there while the better man refuses to spill your blood. Mercy is the mark of a great man.
MAL: (pokes Atherton in the belly with the sword) Guess I'm just a good man.
MAL: (pokes him again for good measure) Well, I'm all right.
Inara puts her arm around the wobbly Mal to support him, and they walk off together.
ATHERTON: (calling after them) Inara. Inara!
HARROW: (to Atherton) You've lost her lad. Be gracious.
ATHERTON: You set this up, whore. After I bought and paid for you. I should have uglied you up so much no one else'd want you.
MAL: (to Inara) See how I'm not punching him? I think I've grown.
ATHERTON: (to Inara) Well get ready to starve. I'll see that you never work again.
INARA: (to Atherton) Actually, that's not how it works. You see, you've earned yourself a black mark in the client registry. No Companion is ever going to contract with you, ever again.
HARROW: (to Atherton) You'll have to rely on your winning personality to get women. God help you.
HARROW: (to Mal) You didn't have to wound that man.
MAL: Yeah, I know, it was just funny.
HARROW: (walks away with Inara and Mal) You willing to fight that hard to protect my property, I'll have it in your hold before midnight.
Mal shakes hands with Harrow, smile and laughs.
Harrow walks off.
MAL: (to Inara) Mighty fine shindig.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO HOLD
JAYNE: (whispers to the crew around the crate/card table) Doc is filling Shepherd in on the plan.
Doc is the diversion.
Light spills in from an opened door.
MAL: Did you ever see such a lazy crew. Mal walks in being supported by Inara.
KAYLEE: Captain.
SIMON: You're hurt.
BADGER: You get us a deal then?
MAL: I got a deal. Now get off my ship.
BADGER: Ta very much for a lovely night, then.
Badger whistles and motions to his gang, and they leave Serenity.
Mal and Inara sit down, Book comes over.
BOOK: Are you badly hurt? Mal nods.
JAYNE: We was just about to spring into action, Captain. Complicated escape and rescue op.
WASH: I was going to watch. It was very exciting.
(Cut to an exterior shot of Serenity flying through space.)

INT. SERENITY - CORRIDORS
Kaylee is walking down the corridors of the ship humming and skipping just a little to herself. She goes to her room, flops onto her bunk, and tunes a tiny speaker to classical music. She stares up at the pink, frilly dress which is hanging over her bed, obviously happy.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO HOLD
Mal and Inara are sitting on the walkway overhead, legs dangling. There is a large glass jug beside them, and they are drinking out of mis-matched cups.
INARA: Thank you for the wine. It's... very fresh.
MAL: To Kaylee and her inter-engine fermentation system.
They clink cups and Mal winces, a bit more dramatically than necessary.
INARA: Are you in pain?
MAL: Absolutely. I got stabbed, you know, right here.
Mal lifts his shirt to show her the bloody bandage on his abdomen.
INARA: (turning away, squeamish) I saw.
MAL: Don't care much for fancy parties. Too rough.
INARA: It wasn't entirely a disaster.
MAL: (incredulous) I got stabbed! Right here!
INARA: You also lined up exciting new crime.
MAL: It's good to have cargo. Makes us a target for every other scavenger out there, though, but sometimes that's fun too.
INARA: I am grateful, you know, for the ill-conceived and high-handed attempt to defend my honor, although I didn't want you to.
MAL: Gracious as that is, looking back, I probably should have stayed out of your world.
INARA: My world? If it is that. I wasn't going to stay, you know.
MAL: Yeah? Why is that?
INARA: Oh, someone needs to keep Kaylee out of trouble. And all my things are here. Besides, why would I want to leave Serenity?
MAL: Can't think of a reason.
(Cut to a distance shot of Mal and Inara, drinking companionably. We then see the hold is full of Harrow's cargo... cattle.)

Establishing shot. High-tech security fence surrounds the mansion.

INT. LARGE MANSION - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
We're in a study or living room. Spacious, lushly appointed, a fire crackling in the fireplace.

Chyron reads:
TAM ESTATE, 11 YEARS AGO
Young Simon Tam sits on the couch doing his homework. Young River Tam is playing behind the couch.
YOUNG_RIVER: (peeping up from behind couch) We're in trouble.
YOUNG_RIVER: (beat) We got cut off!
YOUNG_SIMON: Cut off from what?
YOUNG_RIVER: Our platoon, Simon. We got outflanked by the independent squad, and we're never gonna make it back to our platoon.
YOUNG_RIVER: (beat) We need to resort to cannibalism.
YOUNG_SIMON: That was fast. Don't we have rations or anything?
YOUNG_RIVER: They got lost. We're gonna have to eat the men.
YOUNG_SIMON: Aren't you supposed to be practicing for your dance recital?
YOUNG_RIVER: I learned it all. (re: his homework) That's wrong.
YOUNG_SIMON: It's from the book, River.
YOUNG_RIVER: No, the book is wrong. This whole conclusion is fallacious.
Simon smiles, puts his homework away. Turns to River.
YOUNG_SIMON: So... how'd the independents cut us off?
YOUNG_RIVER: They were using dinosaurs.
YOUNG_SIMON: (incredulous) [Jien tah-duh guay! - "Like hell!"]
GABRIEL TAM enters the study.
GABRIEL: Language, young man.
YOUNG_SIMON: Sorry, dad. The independents attacked us with dinosaurs.
YOUNG_RIVER: Simon lost his head in the heat of battle.
GABRIEL: (chuckling) [Nah mei guan-shee. - "That has nothing to do with it."] Because there were dinosaurs involved, I think we'll let it slide.
YOUNG_SIMON: Did you get my wave?
GABRIEL: I got it. Your text shorted. I got the whole thing during a board meeting. Thank you.
YOUNG_SIMON: If I had a dedicated source box, it wouldn't short out. I lost half my essay.
GABRIEL: Yes, and you'd have access to any [tyen-shiao duh - "heaven knows what"] that filtered in from the cortex. I absolutely forbid it!
YOUNG_SIMON: (pleading) Dad...
YOUNG_RIVER: Dad...
GABRIEL: I will not have it in my house. (beat) But since your mother's already ordered you one, I guess I should give up the fantasy that this is my house!
YOUNG_ SIMON: Are you kidding?
GABRIEL: You will repay me by becoming a brilliant doctor. That's the deal. Dedicated source box -- brilliant doctor.
YOUNG_RIVER: When do I...?
GABRIEL: (dismissive) Many years.
YOUNG_SIMON: Dad, this is so [da bianhua - "big change"]! It's really gonna --
GABRIEL: I know. You think I'd let you work with something second-rate?
YOUNG_SIMON: Thank you.
GABRIEL: You're worth it. (beat) Now do you think it's possible for you two geniuses to give your tired old dad a couple minutes' quiet?

INT. SERENITY - COMMON AREA - CONTINUOUS
Back to the present. River is struggling and shouting, Simon is attempting to calm her.
RIVER: (collapses onto couch) No! No, I don't wanna go back to the...
SIMON: It's okay. It --
RIVER: It's not okay! (beat) You can't just dig into me, shove twenty needles in my eyes and ask me what I see!
SIMON: I... we won't go in. Look. (shuts infirmary doors) No test today.
RIVER: No rutting tests? Stupid son of a bitch, dress me up like a gorramn doll!
SIMON: No tests, no shots... (beat) I'm, uh, I'm just gonna give you a smoother that'll...
River stands, takes Simon's case of medical supplies, and tosses it.
SIMON: River! Mal is walking down the steps to the infirmary as this happens. None too pleased.
RIVER: (to Mal) You're not him? (beat) [Liou coe shway duh biao-tze huh hoe-tze duh ur-tze.] River wilts and sits back on the couch. Mal continues down the stairs.
MAL: So, she's added cussing and hurling about of things to her repertoire. She really is a prodigy.
SIMON: It's just a bad day.
MAL: No, a bad day is when someone's yellin' spooks the cattle. Understand? (beat) You ever see cattle stampede when they got no place to run? It's kind of like a... a meat grinder. And it'll lose us half the herd.
SIMON: She hasn't gone anywhere near the cattle.
MAL: No, but in case you hadn't noticed, her voice kinda carries. We're two miles above ground and they can probably hear her down there. Soon as we unload, she can holler until our ears bleed.
MAL: (to River) Although I would take it as a kindness if she didn't.
RIVER: The human body can be drained of blood in 8.6 seconds given adequate vacuuming systems.
MAL: (to Simon) See, morbid and creepifying, I got no problem with, long as she does it quiet-like.
SIMON: This is paranoid schizophrenia, Captain. Hand-crafted by government scientists who thought my sister's brain was a rutting playground. I have no idea what'll set her off. If you have some expertise --
MAL: (firmly) I'm not a doctor. And I'm not your gorramn baby-sitter, either. Gag her, if you have to. We got trade to be done.
Mal exits via the stairs. Simon sighs heavily.

EXT. PLANET - DAY
(Establishing shot of Serenity landing on the planet's surface.)
(REVERSE camera to reveal three hill folk sitting in a copse of trees, all men. One of the men is skinning a rabbit hung from a tree.)
STARK: You see that? Fancy vessel such as that don't land here 'less they got something to sell. And if it's something we need... He RIPS the skin off the rabbit in one move.
STARK: We take it.

BLACK OUT.


EXT. JIANGYIN PLANET/SERENITY'S CARGO BAY DOORS - DAY
Simon is walking down the cargo bay ramp. The ramp's covered in cow pies. Simon's carefully picking his way around them, but Jayne herds some cattle past him, and Simon stumbles into some cow poo.
JAYNE: (amused) 'Bout time you broke in them pretty shoes.
JAYNE: (to cattle) Yah! Get along!
Simon ignores Jayne, walks off the ramp.
MAL: You know, they walk just as easy if you lead 'em.
JAYNE: I like smackin' 'em.
(REVERSE camera to see the cattle trotting along a hastily-erected corral consisting of metal gates fastened together.)

CUT TO:
Book tying off part of the corral, watching the cattle walk past.
BOOK: Hope this corral's strong enough to hold them. "Shepherd's" a purely figurative title, you know.
(Follow Book with camera to reveal WASH and ZOE seated on top of the corral to the right, also watching the cattle.)
ZOE: (chuckling) Next time we smuggle stock, let's make it something smaller.
WASH: Yeah, we should start dealing in those black-market beagles.

CUT TO:
River sitting on the ground outside the corral, staring at a calf.
RIVER: Little soul, big world. Eat, sleep, and eat... Many souls.
MAL: (to Jayne) Cattle on the ship three weeks, she don't go near 'em. Suddenly we're on Jiangyin and she's got a driving need to commune with the beast?
RIVER: They weren't cows inside. They were waiting to be, but they forgot. Now they see the sky and they remember what they are.
MAL: (to Jayne) Is it bad that what she said made perfect sense to me?
MAL: (beat) C'mon, now. Let's get you clear of the work.
SIMON: (O.S.) What's going on?
(REVERSE camera to show Simon approaching the corral where Mal, Jayne and River are standing.)
SIMON: What are you doing?
MAL: I'm fixing to do some business. Can't be herding these steers and your sister, too.
SIMON: She didn't mean any harm.
MAL: I never figured she did. But when a man engages in clandestine dealings, he has his preference for things being smooth.
(Quick cut to the bushes shaking -- but there's no wind. Could it be hill folk baiting the schmuck?)
MAL: She makes things not be smooth.
SIMON: (snippy) Right. I'm very sorry if she tipped off anyone about your cunningly concealed herd of cows.
MAL: (guides Simon away from the corral) I'm starting to think you got a little too much time on your hands, doctor. I think now I got a notion regarding that. Why don't you take your sister for a little walk.
SIMON: A walk?
MAL: Yeah. Someplace... away.
SIMON: Uh, probably best we stay close. Alliance has us marked as fugitives.
MAL: Closest Alliance is the Cruiser Magellan. Hours out from here. And I promise you, they ain't coming to a backwater like Jiang.
SIMON: Still, I'm not sure it's such a wise suggestion.
MAL: Might not wanna mistake it for a suggestion. (beat) Don't worry, we won't leave without ya.

EXT. JIANGYIN - GENERAL STORE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
(Establishing shot of dusty street, dilapidated but very much inhabited buildings.)

INT. GENERAL STORE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Inara and Kaylee are browsing. The store's light is dim and yellow, shelves are cluttered with cheap knick knacks.
INARA: Does it seem every supply store on every 'water planet has the same five rag dolls and the same wood carvings of... what is this? A duck?
KAYLEE: That's a swan. (beat) I like it.
INARA: You do?
KAYLEE: (stroking swan) Looks like it was made with, you know, longing. Made by a person really longed to see a swan.
INARA: Perhaps they'd only heard of them by rough description.
KAYLEE: (holding up a painted plate) You think this would make a nice gift?
INARA: A gift? For whom?
KAYLEE: I just kinda like it. (beat) It's rich, you know?
INARA: Ooh. For Simon.
KAYLEE: I didn't say that.
INARA: (chuckling) You don't do a very good job of hiding your interest.
KAYLEE: He's just so [shuai - "handsome"]. You just wanna take a bite out of him all over, you know?
INARA: (softly) Careful.
Inara indicates something behind Kaylee. Getting it, Kaylee turns to greet Simon and River, who have just entered the store.
KAYLEE: Morning, you two.
INARA: Don't usually see you two out and about planet-side.
SIMON: Yeah, we're... we're trying something different today.
SIMON: (to River) River, be careful with that... that's, um...
SIMON: (to Kaylee) What is that?
KAYLEE: It's a post-holer. You dig holes. For posts.
SIMON: (separating River from the post-holer) It's, uh, it's dirty. And sharp.
SIMON: (to River) Let's come over here.
SIMON: (picks up plate Kaylee was looking at earlier) Jiangyin prairie paradise. Good god. They're asking money for this crap?
KAYLEE: (somewhat crestfallen) Hard to believe ain't it? Glad you're out.
SIMON: Mm.
KAYLEE: Give you a chance to have a little fun.
SIMON: Fun. Right, yeah.
SIMON: (runs to rescue knick knacks from River) I, uh, I consider this fun. It's fun, being forced to the ass-end of the galaxy. To get to live on a piece of [luh-suh -"crappy"] wreck. And to eat molded protein. And to be bullied around by our [boo-tai jung tzhang duh] of a captain. It's fun.
KAYLEE: (hurt) [Luh-suh? - "Crappy?"]
SIMON: Sorry?
KAYLEE: Serenity ain't [luh-suh - "crappy"].
SIMON: No, I... I didn't mean --
KAYLEE: Yeah you did. You meant everything you just said.
SIMON: Well, no. Uh, actually I was being ironic, so in-in-in the strictest sense --
KAYLEE: You were being mean, is what. (beat) And if that's what you think of this life, then you can't think much of them that choose it, can you.
Kaylee exits the store. Inara follows, giving Simon a significant, "You screwed up," look as she exits. Simon sighs heavily, then turns around. River's nowhere to be seen.
SIMON: River?

EXT. JIANGYIN/SERENITY'S CARGO BAY DOOR - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Mal and Jayne are walking down the cow-pie-riddled cargo bay ramp.
MAL: This is the last time. Last time with cows. Hear there was an idea regarding beagles? They have smallish droppings?
(REVERSE camera to reveal ZOE approaching Serenity from the corral.)
ZOE: I believe so, sir. Also, your disreputable men are here.
MAL: Better go take their money.

EXT. JIANGYIN - CORRAL - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Mal approaches the corral, where Jayne is keeping watch on the cattle. Two men are standing outside the corral.
MAL: Morning, gentlemen. You must be the Grange brothers. Hope you're in the mood for beefsteak.
JAYNE: Attractive animals, ain't they?
OLDER_GRANGE: T'ain't well fed. Scrawny.
MAL: [Fei hua. - "Crap talk."] Milk and hay, three times a day. Fed to 'em by beautiful women.
JAYNE: (gleefully) That was somethin' to see.
YOUNGER_GRANGE: They's branded.
MAL: Oh, you boys are hittin' all the sellin' points. A fresh brand's a dead giveaway. Claim 'em as your own.
OLDER_GRANGE: Twenty a head.
MAL: That's an amusing figure, in light of we already agreed on thirty with Badger.
OLDER_GRANGE: That's afore we seen 'em. They're atrophied, standin' around on a ship for near a month.
MAL: My comprehension is less muscle, more tender the meat. Thirty.
BOOK: (aside, to Mal) Problem?
MAL: (to Book) No. 'Bout a minute from now, we'll agree on twenty-five.
The Grange brothers startle at a rattling noise, their hands going to their guns.
BOOK: (to Mal) Seem a mite jumpy to you?

EXT. JIANGYIN STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS
River walks into an alley in the distance. REVERSE camera to show Simon, agitated, running out of the General Store looking for River. REVERSE camera to reveal a posse of lawmen walking down the steps of a building across the street, then crossing the street to walk into the building right past Simon, who looks down on the ground nervously.
SIMON: Morning, officers. The last officer tips his hat brim at Simon's greeting. Once they're all inside, he bolts across the street after River.

EXT. CORRAL - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Grange brothers are still negotiating with Mal.
OLDER_GRANGE: I'm thinking... maybe we walk away entirely.
MAL: I'm thinking, you do that, and we got ourselves trouble.
MAL: (re: Inara and Kaylee returning to ship) Mornin', ladies.
MAL: (to Grange brothers) Serious trouble. Of the you-owe-us variety.
OLDER_GRANGE: We can go to twenty-five.
MAL: Well... we'd be takin' a loss, but you seem like clean and virtuous boys. Done.
Older Grange brother is taking out his bag of cash, when suddenly, the lawmen we just saw in town burst out of the brush with their guns drawn.
HEAD_COP: Marcus and Nathaniel Grange! You are wanted in connection to the illegal killing of Rance Durbin. You are bound by law to stand down!
MAL: (to Jayne) You know, I'm starting to find this whole planet very uninviting.
JAYNE: Yeah. Off that,

EXT. JIANGYIN ALLEY - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Simon is walking down a dim, uninviting alley. At the end of alley is a green field with a platform set up surrounded by a crowd.

EXT. JIANGYIN FESTIVAL - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Musicians are playing lively music, and people are dancing on the stage. River wanders up onto the stage, at first confused. Then she watches the steps, smiles, and joins in on the dance. Simon watches, awed.

EXT. CORRAL - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Close on gunbelts being dropped to the dirt.
JAYNE: (re: gunbelt) Aww, careful with that!
MAL: It appears we have ourselves a situation.
HEAD_COP: Who are you?
MAL: Just a bystander.
HEAD_COP: This your beef?
MAL: No, sir. (re: Grange brothers) You're lookin' at the proper owners right there.
HEAD_COP: Mm-hmm. (to Grange brothers) I'd like to see some papers on that cattle.
The Younger Grange brother punches one of the lawmen and steals his pistol. Before he can shoot, it's shot out of his hand by Zoe, positioned high up on the hill overlooking the corral. Shots are firing off pretty regularly now, chaos ensues.
OLDER_GRANGE: (yelling) Come on, hurry up!
Older Grange has a pistol by now and shooting off covering fire so he and his brother can get away. As a bullet zings by, Mal and Jayne drop to the ground, crawling forward toward their gunbelts and the sack of money.
JAYNE: Here we go.
MAL: Never goes smooth. How come it never goes smooth?

EXT. JIANGYIN FESTIVAL - DAY - CONTINUOUS
River dances, Simon watches.

EXT. CORRAL - DAY - CONTINUOUS
The midst of a firefight. Mal reaches forward for the money, nearly gets his hand shot off for his trouble. He reaches again, grabs it, rolls back toward Jayne, narrowly avoiding a shot to the head.

River startles suddenly, losing the rhythm of the dance. Simon looks concerned.

EXT. CORRAL - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Close on Book's face. He's barely conscious.

EXT. JIANGYIN FESTIVAL - DAY - CONTINUOUS
As Simon watches River, men come up behind him and put a bag over his head, dragging him away from the festival. River, scared and startled, is shoved about by the dancers, the music ominous.

EXT. CORRAL - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Shepherd Book is wounded on the ground, Mal leaning next to him. It's a bullet wound, just above his heart.
MAL: Hey. Stay with me, Shepherd.
BOOK: That's... that's quite a lot of blood, isn't it?
MAL: (nodding) Just means you ain't dead.
BOOK: Afraid I might be needing a preacher.
MAL: That's good. You lie there and be ironical.
MAL: (to Jayne) Stretcher.
Jayne doesn't move, watching the lawmen escort the Grange brothers away.
MAL: Jayne.
JAYNE: They goin'?
MAL: Of course. They got what they came here for.
JAYNE: You get the cash?

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY - CONTINUOUS
Jayne and Mal put the stretcher on an examination table and remove the side supports.
JAYNE: (to Mal) Don't look good.
Mal crosses to the intercom.
MAL: Wash, get down to the infirmary, [ma-shong! - "on the double!"]
MAL: (to others)We gotta try and stop this bleeding.
Zoe cuts Book's bloody shirt from him. Mal and Zoe do some battle triage.
KAYLEE: (tearfully) Don't you worry, Shepherd. Cap and Zoe got lots of experience with this kind of thing. Seen a lot worse in the war. (beat) Shepherd? (beat) Oh, god, he ain't breathin'.
Book's back arches and he goes into convulsions. Zoe pulls the cap off a hypodermic needled with her teeth and hands it to Mal, who injects it into Book's arm. The convulsions stop.
MAL: He ain't dead. But he is bad off. Now we gotta see what we can do to help him.
WASH: (entering) [Lao-tyen, boo.]
MAL: Wash, I want you to go to town. See if you can't find that [jing tzahng mei yong duh - "useless"] of a doctor.
KAYLEE: Hurry.

EXT. JIANGYIN FOREST - DAY - CONTINUOUS
The three hill folk we saw in the teaser have kidnapped Simon! They rush him along, still with the bag over his head.
STARK: Faster. Got to go faster. Want to get there 'fore dark!
SIMON: Get where? Where are we going?
STARK: Shut up!
SIMON: If it's ransom you want, I... I can arrange something.
STARK: No talking!
SIMON: Look, you don't understand. My sister...
One of the kidnappers punches Simon in the face. Simon hits the ground.

INT. TAM ESTATE - FLASHBACK - NIGHT
Forward in time from the last flashback. Simon is an adult now.
REGAN: Your sister is fine, Simon.
SIMON: She's not fine. Didn't you look at the letters? Look at the letters.
GABRIEL: Uh, I'm looking at letters.
SIMON: These phrases -- they don't sound anything like her. Some of these words -- they're misspelled. (off their looks) She started correcting my spelling when she was three. She's trying to tell us something. I think there's a code.
REGAN: A code?
SIMON: Yes.
GABRIEL: (chuckling) I always thought it was River who was lost without her big brother. Now I'm beginning to wonder if it isn't the other way around.
SIMON: Did you have a good time at the D'arbanville's ball this year?
GABRIEL: What are you...?
SIMON: River thought it was duller than last year. But since we don't know anybody named D'arbanville, I'm having trouble judging. (angrily) Did you even read these?
GABRIEL: Well, of course I did.
REGAN: It's one of her silly games. You two are always playing.
SIMON: She is trying to tell us something that somebody doesn't want her to say.
REGAN: Simon, this is paranoid. It's stress. If they heard you talking like this at the hospital, it could affect your entire future.
SIMON: Who cares about my future?
GABRIEL: You should.
REGAN: You're a surgeon in one of the best hospitals in Capital City. On your way to a major position, possibly even the Medical Elect. You're going to throw all of that away? Everything you've worked for your whole life?
GABRIEL: Being a doctor means more to you than just a position, I know that.
REGAN: A few months time, you'll turn around and there she'll be. Now, nothing is going to keep you two apart for long.

EXT. JIANGYIN FOREST - DAY - CONTINUOUS
The hill folk are herding Simon along.
SIMON: No. Oh, no.

RIVER: Found you!
SIMON: Go!
The hill folk quickly nab River and Simon both.
STARK: Bring her.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
Wash pulls into the cargo bay on his four-wheel.
KAYLEE: Where's the doctor? Why isn't he with you?
WASH: He wasn't in town. Wasn't anywhere.
KAYLEE: He was in town. We saw him there. Him and River. I can show you --
WASH: Town's not that big, Kaylee. Believe me when I say he wasn't there.
JAYNE: Knew it. Probably saw them cops, turned tail.
MAL: (entering) Doctor could be called a lot of things. Coward wouldn't be one of 'em, though.
INARA: You don't think they were arrested, do you?
WASH: Worse than that, probably. Looks like maybe they got snatched.
INARA: Kidnapped?
WASH: I went by the sheriff's office. Seems if we had checked the posted alerts for this rock, we might've known it. Settlers in the hills take people sometimes. Usually tradesmen and the like.
MAL: And now they got themselves a doctor. And we don't. (beat) We're goin'.
Mal moves to the cargo bay controls, begins shutting the bay door.
KAYLEE: Wh-what are you doing? What about Simon and River?
MAL: Forget them. We already lost two people today. If I can help it, we won't lose a third.
MAL: (to Wash) Wash, get us in the air.

EXT. JIANGYIN FOREST - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Simon and River are being herded by the hill folk.

BOOK: That bad?
ZOE: Battle wounds are nothing new to me, preacher. I've seen men live with a dozen holes in 'em this size.
BOOK: That right?
ZOE: Surely is. Knew a man whole had a hole clean through his whole shoulder, once. Used to keep a spare hankie in there.
BOOK: Where's the doctor? Not back yet?
ZOE: (beat) We don't make him hurry for the little stuff. He'll be along.
BOOK: He could hurry... a little.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
Mal and Wash are hunched over a terminal.
WASH: Well, there's Greenleaf. They'd have med help there.
MAL: Too far -- more than ten hours. Man's worse off than that.
INARA: (entering) You know where you can find what you need.
MAL: Don't recall inviting you onto the bridge.
INARA: You didn't. Mal, you know where you can find a doctor. You know exactly.
MAL: Inara, he was dumb enough to get himself grabbed in broad daylight. Don't have time to be beatin' the trees looking for him now. No assurance we'd find him, or he wouldn't need a doctor himself.
INARA: I'm not talking about Simon. I'm talking about medical facilities.
MAL: That's not an option, nor is it a discussion I much want to have at the moment.
INARA: It doesn't matter what you want. He's dying, and we need a doctor now.

Jayne is tossing Simon's room, stealing all the valuables he can find. He comes across a journal of Simon's, opens it up, reads to himself out loud:
JAYNE: (mock reading) "Dear Diary, Today I was pompous and my sister was crazy." (flips page) "Today, we were kidnapped by hill folk never to be seen again. It was the best day ever."
Jayne tosses aside the journal and continues searching Simon's belongings. He finds some money, pockets it.
JAYNE: Now we're talkin'. 
Jayne pulls out a fancy maroon shirt and shakes it out, holding it up as if sizing it.
JAYNE: Amazing we kept him this long.

Zoe is sitting with Book in the infirmary. Kaylee enters hesitantly.
KAYLEE: (re: holding Book's hand) Can I?
ZOE: Sure. He's out, though.

ZOE: I cleaned it out, wrapped it up. Best I could do. (off Kaylee's look) I don't know.
KAYLEE: Well, we're headed for help... right?
ZOE: Captain will come up with a plan.
KAYLEE: That's good. Right?
ZOE: Possibly you're not recalling some of his previous plans.
This barely gets a smile out of Kaylee. Beat.
KAYLEE: We left them back there.

Stark is showing Simon and River into the makeshift hospital.
STARK: In here. (beat) I don't figure it's as fancy as you're used to, but it's what we got. (to Doralee) I got your doctor. Doralee, a young, soft-voiced black woman, rises from tending a sick child.
DORALEE: Oh, praise the Lord.
STARK: Doralee here'll show you what's what.(exits)
DORALEE: (to Simon) What's your name?
RIVER: Simon.
DORALEE: Well, hello there. Who are you?
SIMON: This is... River. (guides River to a bench) River... just, uh, just sit down. Over there. (to Doralee) Has there been, uh... is there a sickness here?
DORALEE: Not especial. Just people get sick or injured. Mostly people heal on their own, but sometimes...
SIMON: Sometimes, you need a doctor. (beat) Bring me light, and any supplies you have.

Mal and Jayne and carrying Book on a stretcher. Zoe is in the lead, opening the cargo bay doors.
ZOE: You sanguine about the kind of reception we're up to receive on an Alliance ship, Cap?
MAL: Absolutely. (beat) What's "sanguine" mean?
ZOE: "Sanguine." Hopeful. Plus, point of interest, it also means "bloody."
MAL: Well, that pretty much covers all the options, don't it?
Zoe opens the cargo bay doors. Alliance soldiers enter, armed and wary. An Alliance Commander steps through last.
MAL: We're requesting aid, no other purpose.
ZOE: We got papers.
COMMANDER: (taking the papers) What's your business?
MAL: We're a supply ship, freelance. Had an accident this morning, crewman got hurt.
ZOE: We need medical help.
MAL: Fast'd be better than slow.
COMMANDER: Official seal's out of date Captain... Harbatkin?
MAL: We ain't been through a checkpoint in a while, sir. You gonna see to my man?
COMMANDER: How did this happen?
ZOE: He was --
MAL: Bystander in a gunfight. Back on Jiangyin. You can check. Not he nor any of ours were the aggressors.
COMMANDER: We aren't an emergency facility, Captain. Our services aren't available simply to anyone.
BOOK: Com... mander... my... ident card.
An Alliance officer removes Book's ident card from his pocket and runs it through a scanner. The officer passes the scanner to the Commander, who says,
COMMANDER: Get this man to the infirmary at once.

INT. HILL FOLK HOSPITAL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Simon is doctoring the hill folk.
SIMON: You keep that bandage clean now, you understand?
(Quick shot of River kneeling down next to a little blonde girl sitting on a cot. Back to Simon and Doralee.)
DORALEE: (re: River) She's not quite right, is she?
SIMON: She's been through some trauma. She's recovering, through.
DORALEE: She won't get a good conversation out of Ruby, I can tell you that much. That little girl's mute.
SIMON: Do you know the cause? Was she born deaf?
DORALEE: No, she was fine until two years ago when she stopped talking. (beat) A place like this might be good for your sister. Quiet. Safe. A place where folks take care of each other.
SIMON: Mmm, yes, seems like a lovely little community of kidnappers.
DORALEE: The Lord says, "Judge not."
SIMON: They took us off the street!
DORALEE: Sometimes life takes you places you weren't expecting to go.
SIMON: "Life" didn't bring us here. Those men did.
DORALEE: You were on a transport ship, right? Taking a journey? It's the way of life in my findings that journeys end when and where they want to, and that's where you make your home.
SIMON: This isn't our home.
DORALEE: If it isn't here... where is it?

INT. ALLIANCE CRUISER MAGELLAN
Jayne, Zoe and Mal are hovering outside the Alliance medical facility, waiting for news.
JAYNE: This place gives me an uncomfortableness.
ZOE: (to Mal) So, what do you figure? Shepherd's got some kind of connection with the Alliance?
MAL: I know what it looks like. Still, it would surprise me if he did.
JAYNE: See, it's my whole problem with pickin' up tourists. Ain't never what they claim to be.
MAL: Seems like everyone's got a tale to tell.

INT. HILL FOLK HOSPITAL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Simon closes the curtains on a hospital bed. He turns around, looks worried.
SIMON: River? River?
DORALEE: What's wrong?
SIMON: River's gone. So's the girl.
DORALEE: Ruby. I'll check out back.
Simon moves to the front door, opening it to see,
SIMON: River, don't... what is that?
RIVER: (holding a skirtful of berries) For you.
SIMON: Oh.
RIVER: I picked them.
SIMON: (holding out a bowl) Here. You'll stain your dress.
RIVER: You have to eat.
They pour the freshly-picked berries into the wooden bowl. River pops a berry into Simon's mouth. He smiles, chews.
SIMON: Hodgeberries. (beat) Do you remember when we found those giant hodgeberry bushes on the Cambersons' estate? And we thought they'd grown wild, but... (beat) Long while ago. 
RIVER: I took you away from there.
SIMON: No.
RIVER: I know I did. You don't think I do, but... (beat) I get confused. I remember everything. I remember too much, and... some of it's made up, and... some of it can't be quantified, and... there's secrets.
SIMON: (softly) It's okay.
RIVER: But I understand. You gave up everything you had to find me. And you found me broken. (beat) It's hard for you. You gave up everything you had.
SIMON: [Mei mei... - "Little sister..."] Everything I have is right here.
RIVER: You need to eat. Keep up your strength. We won't be here long. Daddy will come and take us home. And I'll get better. (beat) I'll get better.
Simon sits down at the table, eating berries. River follows.
SIMON: These are better than the Cambersons' berries.
RIVER: They are. Except they're poison.
Simon spits out the berries, looks panicky.
RIVER: (laughing) He believed her. Made a face.
SIMON: You are such a brat! 
Doralee enters with Ruby.
DORALEE: (to Ruby) You get to bed, now.
SIMON: We should probably think about doing the same. It's been a big day, what with the abduction, and all.
DORALEE: Well, y'all don't have to sleep here. There's a house set aside for you. We've been looking for a doctor for a good while, so things are ready.
SIMON: Really?
RIVER: (re: Ruby) Her sister got killed. Mother got crazy, killed the sister. That one lived.
DORALEE: Ruby talked to you, honey? (to Simon) I-it's true what she's saying. Poor woman went out of her mind. Tried to kill her two girls. Ruby lived. (to River) Sweetheart... you are an angel. No one's been able to get Ruby to speak even a peep. (laughing) It's a miracle, that's what it is.
RIVER: Ruby doesn't talk. Her voice got scared away. (smiles) I hear crickets.
DORALEE: I don't understand. If Ruby didn't talk, how do you know...?
SIMON: Um, my sister's... she-she's very good at... (beat) What's wrong?
DORALEE: (shocked) "And they shall be among the people. And they shall speak truths and whisper secrets and you will know them by their crafts."
SIMON: What are you talking about?
DORALEE: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live!"
Off Simon's confused face,


INT. CAPITAL CITY PENITENTIARY - FLASHBACK - DAY
Gabriel Tam is waiting in a lobby. Simon is escorted in by a guard.
GABRIEL: Have you completely lost your mind?
SIMON: Pretty nearly.
GABRIEL: We got the wave at the Friedlich's. I had to leave your mother at the dinner table.
SIMON: (snidely) I'm sorry, dad. You know I would never have tried to save River's life if I had known there was a dinner party at risk.
GABRIEL: Don't you dare be flippant with me. I just spent two thousand credits to get you out of here, and I had to walk through that door which goes on my permanent profile. (beat) Are you trying to destroy this family?
SIMON: I didn't realize it would be so easy. (beat) Dad, I-I didn't do anything.
GABRIEL: You were in a blackout zone!
SIMON: Talking! To someone who might be able to help River. And I'm going right back there.
GABRIEL: [Whispering in Chinese.] This is a slippery slope, young man. You have no idea how far down you can go, and you're not taking us with you.
SIMON: Meaning what?
GABRIEL: I won't come for you again. You end up here, or get mixed-up in something worse, you're on your own. I will not come for you. (beat) Now, are you coming home?

EXT. HILL FOLK VILLAGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Doralee is ringing a bell that's drawing all the hill folk out of their homes to gather in the town square.
SIMON: This is lunacy. You're supposed to be the teacher here. What exactly is it that you teach?
PATRON: What's going on, woman? Why are you knocking us from our beds at this hour?
DORALEE: The new doctor's sister's a witch. She read Ruby's mind. Saw things she couldn't --
SIMON: No, River is not a witch! (beat) She's just a troubled girl.
PATRON: I'm sure that's true. (to River) You're not a witch, are you, [nyen ching duh? - "youngster?"] I'm the Patron here. Do you know what that means?
RIVER: Yes. You're in charge. Ever since the old Patron died.
PATRON: That's right.
RIVER: He was sick. But he was getting better. You were alone in the room with him.
The Patron lunges forward and hits River.
PATRON: This girl reads minds and spins falsehoods. She's a witch, and we must purge the devil from her. With fire!
River screams. The crowd lunges forward to grab her.

Book is lying on an examination table, all patched up.
MAL: You're gonna be fine, Shepherd. Alliance patched you up.
BOOK: Alliance?
MAL: Yeah. They let us come, and they let us go. What kind of ident card gets us that kind of reception and send off?
BOOK: I am a Shepherd. Folks like a man of God.
MAL: No, they don't. Men of God make everyone feel guilty and judged. That's not what I saw. You like to tell me what really happened?
BOOK: I surely would. And maybe someday I will. (beat) It's good to be home.

INT. SERENITY - COMMON AREA - CONTINUOUS
Jayne is polishing the coins they took off the Grange brothers. Zoe enters.
ZOE: Badger just hailed us. Gettin' impatient for his share. Wants us to drop it to his men on the Kowlan Fed Base.
JAYNE: That'd be a hell of a lot easier to do without the two most wanted on board. Life would look to be simpler us not carrying fugies.
ZOE: (to Mal) He is right, you know.
MAL: Yeah. Simpler.

EXT. HILL FOLK VILLAGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
The hill folk have built themselves a post and pyre right quick. The Patron is hauling River toward it, intent on burning her witch-ass. They tie her to the pole, hands behind her back.
SIMON: Take me instead. Take my life for hers.
PATRON: The witch must die. God commands it.
The Patron nods at some hill folk with torches. They move to light the pyre.
SIMON: No! Get away from her!
Simon runs forward, pulls the hill folk away from River. Simon punches both hill folk out.
SIMON: She has done nothing to you! If she dies tonight, it won't be God's will that killed her, it'll be you! Your lunacy! Your ignorance!
Seeing he's made no impact on the unchanging sea of faces, Simon moves back and steps on the platform holding River.
STARK: That's not going to stop us, doctor.
RIVER: (to Simon) Post-holer. Digging holes for posts.
Tender moment with Simon gazing up at River's smiling face. He rises one last step and wraps his arms around River.
SIMON: Light it.
RIVER: Time to go.
Hold on them for a moment. Then we hear a RUSHING sound of engines overhead.
SERENITY appears over the clearing where the trial is taking place. The CARGO BAY DOORS open to reveal JAYNE in a harness. JAYNE cocks VERA and draws a bead on the hill folk.
MAL and ZOE enter from the back of the crowd, guns drawn. They speak loudly to be heard over the engine noise.
MAL: Well, look at this! Appears we got here just in the nick of time. What does that make us?
ZOE: Big damn heroes, sir.
MAL: Ain't we just. Sorry to interrupt, folks. Y'all got something that belongs to us and we'd like it back.
PATRON: This is a holy cleansing. You cannot think to thwart God's will.
MAL: Y'all see the man hanging out of the spaceship with the really big gun? Now I'm not saying you weren't easy to find. It was kinda out of our way, and he didn't want to come in the first place. Man's lookin' to kill some folk. So really it's his will y'all should worry about thwarting.
MAL: (to Simon) Gotta say, doctor, your talent for alienatin' folk is near miraculous.
SIMON: Yes, I'm very proud.
MAL: Cut her down.
PATRON: That girl is a witch.
MAL: Yeah, but she's our witch. (cocks gun) So cut her the hell down.

Mal is standing outside the infirmary. Simon enters.
SIMON: I've moved him to his room.
MAL: How's he faring?
SIMON: He's gonna be fine. Yeah. They took good care of him.
MAL: Good to know.
SIMON: So finally a decent wound on this ship, and I miss out. I'm sorry.
MAL: Well, you were busy trying to get yourself lit on fire. It happens.
SIMON: Captain... why did you come back for us?
MAL: You're on my crew.
SIMON: Yeah, but you don't even like me. (beat) Why'd you come back?
MAL: You're on my crew. Why we still talking about this? (walks off, over his shoulder) Chow's in ten. No need to dress.

The crew laughs.
River seats herself at the table. Simon pulls out Kaylee's chair as she's about to sit down. She smiles at him, hands Mal the basket of rolls.
MAL: Oh, good. Thank you.
The rolls get passed around the table. River steals the roll from Jayne's plate.
JAYNE: Hey! Wait, wait, wait...
River smiles, everyone laughs, Jayne grabs another rolls from the basket.


EXT. PLANET - TRIUMPH SETTLEMENT - DAY
Two horses pull a covered boat-wagon down the bed of a shallow river, hiding their tracks. About six horsemen burst out of the wooded banks and surround the covered wagon, bringing their progress to a halt. In the front seat sit a husband and wife, their faces covered by a brimmed hat and flowered bonnet, respectively.

BANDIT_#1: Pardon me for intruding, but I believe y'all carrying something of mine.
HUSBAND_(JAYNE): T'ain't your'n!
BANDIT_#1: Did you think we wouldn't find out you changed your route? (beat) You gonna give us what due us, and every damn thing else on that boat. And I think maybe you're gonna give me a little one-on-one time with the missus.
HUSBAND_(JAYNE): Oh, I think you might wanna reconsider that last part. See, I married me a powerful ugly creature.
WIFE_(MAL): How can you say that? How can you shame me in front of new people?
HUSBAND_(JAYNE): If I could make you purtier, I would.
WIFE_(MAL): You are not the man I met a year ago.
Mal and Jayne suddenly draw their guns on the horsemen, Mal slowly pulling his bonnet off.
MAL: Now think real hard. You been bird-dogging this township a while now. They wouldn't mind a corpse of you. Now you can luxuriate in a nice jail cell, but if your hand touches metal, I swear by my pretty flowered bonnet, I will end you.
Mal and Jayne stare down the bandits for a moment, no one moving.
BANDIT_#1: Take 'em!
Zoe leans around the covered wagon and shoots a horseman at the yell. The gunfight begins - Mal, Jayne and Zoe outnumbered but scoring direct hits. Within seconds, all the horsemen are dead.

EXT. CELEBRATION - TRIUMPH SETTLEMENT - NIGHT
Music and dancing. Pan across the merry, rustic crowd.

MAL: (O.S.) In the morning --
We now see Mal and Inara walking through the crowd.
MAL: -- we'll head for Beaumonde. Give you a chance to find some work of your own.
INARA: I appreciate it. (beat) This place is lovely, but...
MAL: Not your clientele? I understand. (Inara laughs) You gotta play at being a lady.
INARA: Well, yes. So, explain to me again why Zoe wasn't in the dress?
MAL: Tactics, woman. Needed her in the back. 'Sides, those soft cotton dresses feel kinda nice. It's the whole... air-flow.
INARA: And you'd know that because...?
MAL: You can't open the book of my life and jump in the middle. Like woman, I'm a mystery.
INARA: Let's keep it that way. I withdraw the question.
(Long shot of the bonfire. Camera moves in on Jayne sitting on a wooden log next to Elder Gommen. Elder Gommen is holding a rain stick, explaining its use to Jayne.)
ELDER_GOMMEN: Makes the rain come for eternity. The rain is very scarce, comes only when needed most. And such it is with men like you. (hands the stick to Jayne)
JAYNE: (drunkenly) This is the most... you, friend. You're the guy... (hugs Elder) I will treasure this.
Book watches from a distance as a young woman puts a crown of daises on Mal's head, then gives him a bowl of wine to drink. Mal drinks the wine, smiling broadly at the young woman. The young woman smiles back and twirls out onto the dance floor. Mal smiles and mouths "flowers" to Jayne, who is sitting next to him. Wash and Zoe are cuddling by the bonfire. After a moment, Mal and Jayne are pulled out to dance by several young women.

EXT. SERENITY - OPEN AIRLOCK - DAY
The crew of Serenity are preparing to leave the planet. Mal is walking toward the airlock with Elder Gommen.
MAL: Elder Gommen, thank you for the hospitality.
ELDER_GOMMEN: We owe you a great debt. I'm sorry we have so little to pay it with -- though I hope our gifts will show our regards.
MAL: Well I don't think Jayne's ever lettin' go of that stick.
(Elder laughs)
ZOE: (to Mal) Mal, there's a patrol boat heading into atmo right now.
MAL: (to Elder) Well we gotta fly.
ELDER_GOMMEN: We'll pray for a safe voyage, and hope to lay eyes on you again 'ere too long, my friend.
MAL: Count on it. Bye now.
ELDER_GOMMEN: Bless you.
Echoes of the settlers calling goodbye as the airlock closes.
(WIDE SHOT of Serenity closing its doors and rising into the atmosphere.)

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
Mal is alone in the cargo bay storing supplies. He squats down to put away what look like propane tanks into a wire cage when he spots a stowaway.
MAL: (surprised) Gaaahhh! (beat; angrily) Who the hell are you?
SAFFRON: What do you mean?
MAL: Well, I think I was pretty clear. What are you doing on my boat?
SAFFRON: But... you know I'm to cleave to you...?
MAL: To-whubba-who?
SAFFRON: Did Elder Gommen not tell you?
MAL: Tell me what? Who are you?
SAFFRON: Mr. Reynolds, sir. (beat) I'm your wife.


INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
Right where we left off, Mal staring at the redheaded stowaway.
SAFFRON: I am your wife. That was your agreement with Elder Gommen, since he hadn't cash or livestock --
MAL: I'm-I'm sorry. Go back to the part... (beat) Where you're my wife?
SAFFRON: I don't please you?
MAL: You can't please me. You never met me.
Zoe and Jayne enter the cargo bay.
MAL: Zoe, why do I have a wife?
JAYNE: You got a wife? All I got is that dumbass stick sounds like it's raining. How come you got a wife?
MAL: I didn't. (to Saffron) We're not married.
SAFFRON: (upset) I'm sorry that I shame you.
MAL: You don't shame me!
MAL: (to Zoe) Zoe, would you get Wash?
Zoe walks to comm, hits it, and then:
ZOE: This is Zoe. We need all personnel in the cargo bay.
MAL: Whoa, whoa. I said Wash.
ZOE: (grinning) Captain, everyone should have a chance to congratulate you on your day of bliss.
MAL: There's-there's no bliss! I don't know this girl!
JAYNE: Then can I know her?
ZOE: (smacks Jayne's arm) Jayne! (beat) Don't sully this.
MAL: You are gonna be cleaning latrines with your face you don't knock that off.
The rest of the crew comes pouring into the cargo bay, curious.
BOOK: Who's the new recruit?
ZOE: Everybody, I want you all to meet... (beat) Mrs. Reynolds.
KAYLEE gasps excitedly. INARA looks less than pleased.
KAYLEE: You got married?!
SIMON: Well, that's, uh... (searching) Congratulations.
WASH: We'd always hoped you two kids would get together. (to Mal) Who is she?
MAL: She's no one!
Saffron bursts into tears.
KAYLEE: Captain.
MAL: (to Saffron) Would you stop that?
SAFFRON: I'm sorry.
WASH: You brute.
KAYLEE: (comforting Saffron) Hey, sweetie. Don't feel bad. He makes everybody cry. He's like a monster.
MAL: I'm not a monster! (to Wash; Jayne laughing) Wash, turn the ship around.
WASH: Can't.
MAL: That's an order.
WASH: Yeah, but can't.
Cutting between Mal and Wash talking, and Book and Simon, all in the cargo bay:
MAL: What the hell is wrong with...
BOOK: (to Simon) Have you got an encyclopedia?
SIMON: (nodding) [Chinese - "Of course."]
WASH: ...the Alliance touched down the second after we left, and there's already a bulletin on the cortex as to the murder of a prefect's nephew. That's right, one of our bandits has family ties. So unless you feel like walk into a gallows, I suggest we continue on to Beaumonde, and you... enjoy your honeymoon.
MAL: This isn't happening. (to Saffron) Would you stop cryin'?
INARA: For god's sake, Mal. Could you be a human being for thirty seconds?
WASH: As one married man to another --
MAL: (yelling) I'm not married! (beat; to Saffron) I'm sorry. You-you have very nice qualities, but I didn't ever marry you.
BOOK: (entering with encyclopedia) I believe you did. Last night.
MAL: (aside, to Jayne) How drunk was I last night?
JAYNE: Well I dunno. I passed out.
BOOK: It says here: (reading) "The woman lays a wreath upon her intended" -- which I do recall -- "which represents his sovereignty."
MAL: (to Saffron) That was you?
BOOK: And he drinks of her wine. And then there's a dance, with a joining of hands. The marriage ceremony of the Triumph settlers. You, sir, are a newlywed.
MAL: (beat) What's it say in there about divorce?
Upset, Saffron runs from the cargo bay.
KAYLEE: [Chinese - "You don't deserve her, you fink."]
MAL: [Chinese - "Mind your own business."]
ZOE: Really think you're the one to talk to her, sir.
MAL: Way I see it, me and her got one thing in common. We're the only ones don't think this is funny.
Mal exits the cargo bay after Saffron.

INT. SERENITY - CORRIDOR
Mal is searching the ship.
MAL: Hello? Woman... person?
Mal climbs upstairs.
Saffron sitting in a corridor quietly crying. Mal enters.
MAL: You all right?
SAFFRON: I thought last night during the ceremony that you were pleased.
MAL: Well, yeah, last night I was. Had some mulled wine, pretty girl gave me a hat made out of a tree. Nobody said I was signing up to have and to hold.
SAFFRON: Are you gonna kill me?
MAL: What?! What kind of crappy planet is that? (scoffs) Kill you.
SAFFRON: In the maiden's home I heard talk of men who weren't pleased with their brides --
MAL: Well I ain't them! And don't you ever stand for that sort of thing. Someone ever tries to kill you, you try to kill 'em right back! (sits next to her) Look, wife or no, you are no one's property to be tossed aside. You got the right same as anyone to live and try to kill people. I mean, you know... people that are... (beat) That's a dumb planet.
SAFFRON: What will you do with me?
MAL: Not rightly sure. We're bound for Beaumonde. Decent kind of planet. Might be able set you up some kind of work there.
SAFFRON: I'll not be anyone's doxy.
MAL: I don't mean whoring. I mean the factories and the like. Some ranches, if you're more for the outdoors. Near a week before we get there. We'll figure something.
SAFFRON: I'd be a good wife.
MAL: Yeah, well, I'd be a terrible husband. You got five whole days to figure that out.
SAFFRON: Five days... we'll be together?
MAL: We'll be together on the ship, but not in any --
SAFFRON: That'll be fine. I'll do for you -- or not -- as you choose.
MAL: Well. Shiny. (beat) Hungry? Kitchen's just through there.
SAFFRON: I'll cook you something.
Saffron moves quickly toward the kitchen area. Mal trails after her.
MAL: Well, no, I meant for you.
SAFFRON: I'm a fine cook. Everyone says.
MAL: That's-that's great. What... Hold it. Hold... (beat) I ain't never even --
SAFFRON: My name is Saffron.
Saffron exits. Book comes into frame, watching Saffron walk away.
BOOK: Divorce is very rare and requires dispensation from her pastor. I can send him a wave, see what I can do.
MAL: I appreciate that. (beat) She's a nice girl.
BOOK: Seems very anxious to please you.
MAL: Well, that's their way, I guess.
BOOK: I suppose so. (beat) If you take sexual advantage of her, you're going to burn in a very special level of hell. A level they reserve for child molesters and people who talk at the theater.
MAL: What -- I am not... preacher, you got a smutty mind!
BOOK: Perhaps I spoke out of turn.
MAL: You may perhaps I'm thinking!
BOOK: I apologize. I'll make her up a room in the passenger dorm.
MAL: Good.
Book walks away and around the corner. A beat later, he pokes his head back around to say:
BOOK: The special hell.

INT. SERENITY - KITCHEN AREA
Saffron puts a plate of food in front of Mal, who is seated at the dinner table.
MAL: Thank you.
Wash and Zoe enter the kitchen area.
WASH: Something smells good.
ZOE: Havin' yourself a little supper, captain?
MAL: Well, Saffron insisted on... you know, I didn't want to make her feel... it's damn tasty!
WASH: Is there any more where that came from?
SAFFRON: I didn't think to make enough for your friends. But everything's laid out if you'd like to cook for your husband.
Wash and Zoe sit at the table.
WASH: (laughs) Isn't she quaint? (to Saffron) I'm just not hungry.
ZOE: So, are you enjoying your own nubile little slave girl?
MAL: She wanted to make me dinner. At least she's not cryin'.
WASH: I might. Did she really make fresh bao? (off Zoe's look) Quaint!
ZOE: Remember that sex we were planning to have, ever again?
MAL: You know what, you all are makin' a big deal. I would appreciate it if someone on this boat would not assume that I'm an evil lecherous [hwin dan - "asshole"].
ZOE: Nobody's saying that, sir.
WASH: Yeah, we're pretty much just giving each other significant glances and laughing incessantly. (beat) Is that cider?
MAL: By the stove.
WASH: Yum. I'll get you a refill, [hwin dan - "asshole"].
Wash takes Mal's cup and stands. Saffron is suddenly there, snatching the glass firmly from Wash's hand.
SAFFRON: That's for me to do. Wash sinks back into his chair and gives Zoe a significant glance.
MAL: You know, um... you weren't lyin' about your cookin'. If I hadn't already eaten... 
SAFFRON: You don't want to finish?
MAL: No, I just -- um, I have captainy things to do. But truthfully, it was a fine meal. Thank you.
SAFFRON: Do you need anything else?
MAL: No. No. Um. You just... have somethin' to eat yourself, and uh, I will go captain --
SAFFRON: If you're done with supper... would you like me to wash your feet?
Mal stares blankly for a beat, then swiftly exits. Wash pulls the plate of bao over to his side of the table.

INT. SERENITY - INARA'S SHUTTLE
Inara sits in front of a console, programming appointments.
INARA: Beaumonde. City of New Dunsmuir. Arrival October 24th. Departure --
MAL: (entering) Can I come in?
INARA: No.
MAL: See? That's why I usually don't ask.
INARA: What do you want?
MAL: (sitting) Oh, I just... needed a place to hide.
INARA: So I take it the honeymoon's over?
MAL: Oh, she's a fine girl, don't misread. A hell of a cook, too.
INARA: I'm sure she has many exciting talents.
MAL: Do you ever... wash your client's feet?
INARA: It's my specialty. (beat) We'll be on Beaumonde at least two weeks, right?
MAL: Mm. Can't exactly be sure.
INARA: Well, I need you to be exactly sure, Mal. I can't make commitments and then not keep them. That's your specialty.
MAL: I'm sorry. Are you tetchy because I got myself a bride or 'cause I don't plan to keep her?
INARA: I find the whole thing degrading.
MAL: That's just what Saffron said about your line of work.
INARA: Maybe you should think twice about letting go of Saffron. You two seem like quite a match.
MAL: Maybe you're right. Maybe we're soulmates.
INARA: Yes. Great. I wish you hundreds of fat children.
MAL: Aw, could you imagine that? Me with a whole passel of critters underfoot? Hell, ten years time I could --
INARA: Could you leave me alone for five minutes, please?
Mal, slightly offended, gets up and leaves Inara's shuttle.

EXT. INARA'S SHUTTLE - DOOR
Mal is closing her door.
MAL: (to Inara) I wasn't lookin' for a fight!

INT. SERENITY - CATWALK
(REVERSE camera to reveal JAYNE standing on the catwalk with a very large gun.)
MAL: Always do seem to find one, though.


INT. SERENITY - CATWALK
Right where we left off, Mal and Jayne squaring off on the catwalk.
JAYNE: There's times I think you don't take me seriously. I think that ought to change.
MAL: Do you think it's likely to?
JAYNE: You got something you don't deserve.
MAL: And it's brought me a galaxy of fun, I'm here to tell ya.
JAYNE: Six men came to kill me one time. The best of 'em carried this. (approaches Mal) It's a Callahan full-bore autolock. Customized trigger, double-cartridge thorough gauge. (beat) It is my very favorite gun. (holds it out to Mal)
MAL: (beat) [Chinese - "The explosive diarrhea of an elephant!"] You offering me a trade?!
JAYNE: A trade?! Hell, it's theft. It's the best damn gun made by man. It has extreme sentimental value. It's miles more worthy than what you got.
MAL: What I got? She has a name.
JAYNE: So does this. I call it Vera.
MAL: Well my days of not taking you seriously are certainly coming to a middle.
JAYNE: Well, damnit Mal, I'd treat her okay.
MAL: She's not to be bought, nor bartered, or borrowed, or lent. She's a human woman doesn't know a damn thing about the world and needs our protection.
JAYNE: Well I'll protect her!
MAL: Jayne!
MAL: (beat) Go play with your rain stick.
Mal walks away, heading down the stairs. Jayne grumbles and exits out of frame.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
Mal hits the bottom of the stairs and rounds the corner only to see,
MAL: Gaahh!
SAFFRON lurking right there.
MAL: You do sneak about, don't you?
SAFFRON: You're a good man.
MAL: You clearly haven't been talking to anyone else on this boat.
SAFFRON: I don't wish to be wed to the large one. I'd rather -- if I am not to be yours -- I'd rather have the work you spoke of. I could be useful on a ranch.
MAL: It's good work. My momma had a ranch -- back on Shadow, where I'm from. Ran cattle, mostly. Wasn't nobody ran harder or smarter. Used to tell me: don't brand the cattle, brand the buyer; he's the one likely to stray.
SAFFRON: She raised you herself?
MAL: Well, her and about forty hands. I had more family for a kid...
MAL: (beat) Well that is odd.
SAFFRON: What?
MAL: I just don't... I'm not one talks about what's past, and here you got me...
SAFFRON: Does your crew never show interest in your life?
MAL: No, they're... they just know me well enough to...
MAL: (beat) What about you? What's your history?
SAFFRON: Not much to say. Life like yours, I'm figure you'd find mine terrible dull.
MAL: Oh, I long for a little dullness. Truth to say, this whole trip's gettin' to be just a little too interesting.

INT. INTERGALACTIC CHOP SHOP
(Closeup of a firefly schematic on a computer monitor screen.)
BREED: It's a wreck.
CORBIN: No, this is good.
BREED: It's parts. A lot of cheap parts we'll never unload.
CORBIN: This is why you'll never be in charge, Breed. You don't see the whole. The parts are crap.
BREED: I said exactly that.
CORBIN: But you put it together you got a Firefly. Thing'll run forever they got a mechanic that's even half awake.
BREED: She's got no flash.
CORBIN: Some people ain't lookin' for flash. She comes this way, you prep the nets.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE

Zoe and Wash are returning to the bridge, arguing.
ZOE: Clearly she's out of her mind.
WASH: Well, she's let a sheltered life.
ZOE: Did you see the way she grabbed that glass from you?
WASH: Every planet has its own weird customs. About a year before we met, I spent six weeks on a moon where the principal form of recreation was juggling geese. My hand of god. (beat) Baby geese. Goslings. They were juggled.
ZOE: Of course. The man rushes in to defend her.
WASH: I'm talking about geese.
ZOE: Captain shouldn't be babysitting a damned groupie, and he knows it.
WASH: Okay, when did this become not funny?
ZOE: When you didn't turn around and put her ass back down on Triumph where it belongs.
WASH: Oh, hey! Now it's even my fault? Is there anything else on your mind that I should know about? There are all kinds of twists and cul de sacs. It's wild!
ZOE: She's trouble.
WASH: I'm getting that.
ZOE: I'm going to bed.

INT. SERENITY - CORRIDOR
Mal is walking down a corridor toward his quarters.

INT. SERENITY - MAL'S ROOM
Mal enters his room from the walkway above, idly unbuttoning his shirt as he walks farther into the room.
MAL: (startled) Hey!
(Camera pans left to reveal an obviously naked Saffron in Mal's bed, covered only by a sheet.)
MAL: You're, uh... uh... well, there you are.
SAFFRON: I've made the bed warm for you.
MAL: It looks, uh, warm.
SAFFRON: And I've made myself ready for you.
MAL: Let's ride right past the part where you explain exactly what that means. Didn't you see you got a room of your own?
SAFFRON: And I'm to sleep there?
MAL: That's the notion. Assuming you're... yeah. Sleepy.
SAFFRON: But we've been wed. Aren't we to become one flesh?
MAL: Well, no, uh... We're still two fleshes here, and I think that your flesh ought to sleep somewhere else.
SAFFRON: I'm sorry. When we talked I'd hoped, but I don't -- (moves to stand)
MAL: Whoa, hey! Flesh... (beat) Listen, Saffron... it ain't a question of pleasing me. It's more a question of what's, um, of what's morally right.
SAFFRON: I do know my bible, sir. (beat) On the night of their betrothal the wife shall open to the man as the furrow to the plow. He shall work in her again and again, til she bring him to his full. And rest him then upon the sweat of her breast.
MAL: Whoa. Good bible.
SAFFRON: I'm not skilled, sir. Nor a pleasure to look upon --
MAL: Saffron, you're pleasing. (sits down) You're... yep, you're all kinds of pleasing, and uh, it's-it's been a while -- a long damn while -- since anybody but me took ahold of my plow, so don't think for a second that I ain't interested. But you and me, we ain't married. Just 'cause you got handed to me by some [hwin dan - "asshole"] couldn't pay off his debts don't make you beholden to me. I keep trying to explain --
SAFFRON: Let me explain. I lived my life in the maiden house waiting to be married off for trade. I seen my sisteren paired off with ugly men. Vicious or blubberous. Men with appetites too unseemly to speak on. And I've cried for those girls. But not half so hard as I cried the night they gave me to you.
MAL: (worried) Why? Is there blubber?
SAFFRON: I cried for I'd not dreamed to have a man so sweet. So kind and beautiful. Had I to dare to choose, I'd choose you from all the planets the night sky could show me. If I'm wed, I am a woman, and I'll take your to leave to be bold. I want this. I swell to think of you in me. And I see that you do, too.
MAL: Oh. That's-that's just, um --
SAFFRON: Leave me at the nearest port. Never look upon me again. I'll make my way with the strength that you've taught me. Only let me have my wedding night.
MAL: Oh, I'm gonna go to the special hell.
They kiss. Mal pulls back reluctantly.
MAL: I-I really, really wish it was that simple, but I...
Saffron pulls him back into the kiss, hotter than before. Suddenly Mal pushes back from Saffron, looking dazed. He looks at his hand awkwardly.
MAL: Son of a...
Mal falls heavily to the floor, drugged to the gills.
SAFFRON: Night, sweetie.


INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Wash is alone on the bridge, piloting Serenity. Saffron enters.
WASH: Well, if it isn't the master chef. Not sleepy?
SAFFRON: Am I allowed to be up here?
WASH: Well, sure. Why not? Not like anyone else is taking up space.
SAFFRON: I've never been off-world before.
WASH: It's beautiful, isn't it?
SAFFRON: It's like a dream.
WASH: Planet I'm from, couldn't see a one of 'em, pollution's so thick. Sometimes I think I entered flight school just to see what the hell everyone was talking about.
WASH: (re: Saffron shutting bridge door) What are you doing?
SAFFRON: Now we're alone. Just us and the stars. No ship, no bellowing engines, no crew to bicker at each other. Look. (pulls Wash out of his chair) Do you know the myth of Earth-that-was?
WASH: Not so much.
SAFFRON: That when she was born, she had no sky, and was open, inviting. And the stars would rush into her, through the skin of her. Making the oceans boil with sensation. And when she could endure no more ecstasy, she puffed up her cheeks and blew out the sky.
WASH: Whoa. Good myth.
SAFFRON: My whole life, I saw nothing but roofs and steeples and the cellar door. A few days I'll be back to that life and gone from yours. Make this night what it should be. Please? Show me the stars.
WASH: [Chinese - "Holy mother of god and all her wacky Nephews"] Do I wish I was somebody else right now. Somebody not... married, not madly in love with a beautiful woman who can kill me with her pinkie!
SAFFRON: I've been too forward.
WASH: No! Well, yes, but I actually like that in a woman. That's part of why Zoe and I are, as recently mentioned, married.
SAFFRON: I thought she didn't seem to respect you.
WASH: Not everybody gets me and Zoe at first glance. Did it get very hot in here? I need air flow.
SAFFRON: You love her very much.
WASH: (emphatically) Yeah. (beat) I never did meet anyone quite like Zoe. The, uh, the first time we met, she actually --
Wash turns his back to Saffron to open the bridge door. PUSH IN on Saffron's face as she rolls her eyes in disgust, then kicks Wash in the head and knocks him out cold.
Saffron rushes to the bridge and begins reprogramming the ship's navigation system, then shorts it out. She drags Wash out of the bridge, then seals the door with a kind of explosive sticky tape.

INT. SERENITY - CATWALK
Saffron is running across the catwalk toward a shuttle door. As she reaches for the door, Inara opens it from the inside and steps out, startling them both.
INARA: Oh! Are you lost?
SAFFRON: I'm sorry. I thought the other shuttle was yours.
INARA: It is. I was on the cortex and my screen shorted. This one's out too.
SAFFRON: Looking for customers?
INARA: What were you looking for?
SAFFRON: I don't mean to be rude. A companion's life is so glamorous and strange. I wish I had the skill for such a trade.
INARA: Like to please your new husband?
SAFFRON: Oh he'll have none of me. For true I'm somewhat relieved. If I'm to learn of love, I'd like it to be at the hands of someone gentle. Someone who could feel what I feel.
INARA: But Mal said... you-you don't approve of my work.
SAFFRON: Sure'n he said that to keep you from me. I was too curious about you. Ever since I saw you...
INARA: Come to my shuttle.
SAFFRON: You would... you would lie with me?
Overhead, an alarm starts sounding, breaking the tension.
INARA: I guess we've lied enough.
SAFFRON: You're good.
INARA: You're amazing. Who are you?
SAFFRON: Malcolm Reynold's widow.
Inara, slightly stunned, blocks a punch from Saffron. Saffron pushes Inara down violently and runs for the shuttle, shutting the door behind her, strapping in, and firing up the engines.

EXT. SPACE - SERENITY
Shot of the shuttle detaching from Serenity and taking off.

INT. SERENITY - CORRIDOR
Inara rounds a corner and ends up outside the bridge. Zoe is hovering over Wash, who is still on the ground.

ZOE: Baby, wake up.
ZOE: (to Inara) He's bleeding!
WASH: There's no one in there.
KAYLEE: (entering) What's going on?
Inara climbs down the ladder from the corridor.

INT. SERENITY - MAL'S ROOM
Inara sees Mal lying on the floor.
INARA: (upset) Mal! Mal-Mal-Mal-Mal-Mal!
She runs to his side and kneels next to him, taking his head in her hands. Mal moans incoherently.
INARA: [Chinese - "Thank god."] Inara kisses him in relief. Inara rises and hits the comm.
INARA: Get the doctor, Mal's hurt. (growing groggy) He...
INARA: (realizing, touching her lips)
Oh... you stupid son of a --
Inara collapses next to Mal on the floor.
(CUT TO: CLOSE, BLURRY SHOT of Mal's face. Focus in as Mal wakes, looking around groggily.)
MAL: Is it Christmas?
(REVERSE to REVEAL the entire crew tightly packed into Mal's room, watching him closely.)
SIMON: Well, he's back.
MAL: What happened about me?
ZOE: Your blushing bride was a plant.
ZOE: (re: Wash) She took both of you out.
MAL: How did...?
SIMON: Narcotic compound. Probably spread over a seal on her lips. You get it on yours, and pow.
ZOE: Lips, huh?
MAL: Well...
SIMON: Yeah, we used to get a lot of guys brought in on the night shift at the ER. Usually robbed, very groggy. They called it the "good night kiss."
ZOE: So you two were kissin'?
BOOK: Well. Isn't that... special?
MAL: Wash, how did --
WASH: Hey, I just got kicked in the head.
ZOE: My man would never fall for that [Chinese - "cheap floozy"].
WASH: Most of my head wishes I had.
MAL: You guys don't understand.
BOOK: Seems pretty simple from here. You were taking advantage of her --
MAL: I was the one being taken advantage of!
BOOK: My apologies. You were victimized, Wash was beaten, and Inara found you here.
INARA: (groggily) Then I fell. My head got hurt like Wash.
MAL: I don't get any of this.
INARA: (groggily) I only fell, is all.
MAL: What the hell's our status?
ZOE: We're shut down. Jayne and Kaylee are trying to get us on the bridge.
WASH: All we know is we're headed somewhere and it ain't Beaumonde.
The crew starts standing and moving out of Mal's room. Simon approaches Inara, who has been propped awkwardly on a bunk throughout the scene, looking like a rag doll.
INARA: (to Simon) I'm-I'm fine. I don't need to be examined. I'm comfy.

INT. SERENITY - CORRIDOR
Jayne lights a blowtorch and pulls down a pair of goggles over his eyes. Behind him, we follow Kaylee as she turns around and jogs down the stairs to meet Mal and company.
KAYLEE: She didn't just lock it, she fused it to something. Both entrances.
MAL: Why the big act? What was she after?
BOOK: Beside the less-than-innocent captain?
MAL: You want to stow it, preacher? We're in some peril here.
ZOE: She can fly this thing, or just take the shuttle.
WASH: Maybe she likes shuttles. (re: Zoe's look) Some people juggle geese!
Jayne finally breaks through the seal on the doors.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Wash and Kaylee are on their backs under the navigation system, staring up at wiring with flashlights.
KAYLEE: She's a pro.
WASH: This is a masterful job of muck-up. See how she crossed the drive feeds?
KAYLEE: Ya-huh.
WASH: So we even try to reroute, it'll lock down. [Chinese - "brilliant"].
KAYLEE: She went straight for the thermal cap.
WASH: Yeah, yeah. We are so hung!
MAL: I'm glad you two are havin' a good time under there. Can we progress to the makin' it right?
WASH: That's not gonna happen for a long while, cap'n.
MAL: Well we don't have a good long while. We could be headin' straight into a nice big solid moon, for all we know. So, how's about we get to work?
KAYLEE: Hey. It was your big make-out session that got us into this, sir.
MAL: I was poisoned!
INARA: You were drugged.
JAYNE: That's why I never kiss 'em on the mouth.
Long beat full of reaction shots while everyone processes this.
MAL: Well what can you do?
WASH: Give us some time, we can get the cortex and nav comm back online. At least see where we're headed.
MAL: What about steering?
INARA: What about stopping?
WASH: She humped us hard. We're gonna have to do a lot of --
MAL: Well do it. Doesn't help me to see where we're going if I can't change course.
KAYLEE: This girl really knows her ships.
INARA: That's not all she knows. She's well-schooled.
SIMON: What do you mean, the sedative? The "good night kiss"?
INARA: Well, I only hit my head, but Mal went through that. But, no... I mean seduction. Body language, signals. She's had training. As in companion. As in academy.
BOOK: Our little Saffron's quite a wonder. I'm beginning to think she married beneath herself.
MAL: How do you know -- about the training,
INARA: She tried to seduce me, too.
MAL: Really? (beat) Did she... did you...
INARA: You don't play a player. It was sloppy of her to try it, but I think she was in a rush.
MAL: Yeah but she had professional... So in my case, it was really... (to Book) You woulda kissed her, too.
ZOE: Wash didn't.
MAL: But she was naked! And all... articulate!
WASH: Okay! Everybody not talking about sex, in here. Everybody else, elsewhere.

INT. INTERGALACTIC CHOP SHOP
Back at the chop shop with the criminals, where a radar screen is beeping.
BREED: They're coming!
CORBIN: How far out?
BREED: Ten minutes or so, right on target.
CORBIN: Speed?
BREED: A1.
CORBIN: That girl's a wonder.
BREED: She gets it done. Tell the boys.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Wash is working on restoring the nav comm.
WASH: Yes!
MAL: You got it?
WASH: Uh, we got light, we got screens. It's a qualified yes. A partial.
MAL: What about nav control?
KAYLEE: No.
MAL: So where are we headed?
WASH: The coordinates she entered we're headed for something and it's not too far.
MAL: Did she signal anybody?
WASH: Uh... [chinese - "hold on a minute"]. She did. Same coordinates, no ID.
JAYNE: Who's out there?
WASH: Let me see if her signal wave can translate into a visual. There might be... (looks at red blob on radar) Electromagnetic interference, uh... bouncing the signal all over the place. Look at it. Looks like a circle.
MAL: It's a net.
JAYNE: I don't get it. Where we headed?
BOOK: The end of the line.

EXT. SPACE - ELECTROMAGNETIC NET
Slowly pull back on the giant net that houses our intergalactic chop shop.


INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Right where we left the crew, realizing their fate.
BOOK: It's a carrion house. Scrap shop. Takes ships, pulls 'em apart, or fixes 'em up.
WASH: Doesn't sound that scary.
MAL: That pattern you're lookin' at is a net. We fall into that we're more than just helpless. It'll turn this ship into one big electrical conduit and burn us all from the inside out.
BOOK: Some of the newer ones will just hold you, and then the scrappers will override the airlocks. Pull the O2 or just gas you. They're not lookin' to deal with survivors.
JAYNE: One day you're gonna tell us all how a preacher knows so damn much about crime.
MAL: Kaylee?
KAYLEE: I'm trying, sir.
MAL: Keep on it. We can't fall into that net. (beat) We're gonna need a Plan B.
Mal comes up with some kind of idea, walks across the bridge and hits the comm.
MAL: (to Zoe) Zoe, get our suits prepped now.
MAL: (to Wash) I figure we got one shot at this. Gimme a visual as soon as we're close.
WASH: It won't be long.
JAYNE: What do I do?
MAL: You go get Vera.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
Mal, Zoe and Jayne are suiting up in their mylar space suits. Jayne is loading Vera.
JAYNE: She needs oxygen around her to fire and we don't have a case.
MAL: Gonna use a suit.
SIMON: (bringing the suit) Here. We got it.
JAYNE: What am I aimin' for, the window?
MAL: Well that might kill some folk but it won't short the net. See these six points where it's brightest? Those are the breakers. Hit one of those, should short it out.
JAYNE: What do you mean "should"?

Long moment, then Jayne fires at the net.

Wash is looking triumphant.
WASH: We got it. Mal enters, looking hopeful.
WASH: It's not pretty, but we can steer enough to turn the hell around.
MAL: Nice work, Jerry Lee.
KAYLEE: Not soon enough to help.
MAL: Hey. Lot easier to pull things apart than it is put 'em right. Let's do the best we can at floatin'.
Mal kisses the top of Kaylee's head.
WASH: Captain, didn't you know kissin' girls makes you sleepy?
MAL: Well sometimes I just can't help myself. (beat) Now, let's go visiting.

EXT. PLANET SURFACE - WINTER - DAY

INT. CABIN - DAY
Saffron, now made up and wearing revealing clothing, is packing when Mal bursts through the door with his gun drawn.
MAL: Honey, I'm home. Saffron freezes, then struggles with Mal. After a moment, he wrestles her onto the bed, pinning her arms and legs.
MAL: Looks like you get that wedding night, after all.
Saffron rolls them off the bed and they hit the floor, her back on the bottom after another struggle.
MAL: It's the first time, darlin'. I think you should be gentle with me.
SAFFRON: You gonna kill me?
MAL: Can you conjure up a terribly compelling reason for me not to?
SAFFRON: I didn't kill you.
MAL: You handed me and my crew over to those that would kill us. That buys you nothing.
SAFFRON: I made you dinner.
MAL: Why the act? All the seduction games, the dancin' about folk? There has to be an easier way to steal.
SAFFRON: You're assuming the payoff is the point.
MAL: I'm not assuming anything at this juncture.
SAFFRON: How'd you find me?
MAL: Only a few places that shuttle would make it to from where you left. Happy to find it intact.
SAFFRON: You're quite a man, Malcolm Reynolds. I've been waiting a long time for someone good enough to take me down.
Beneath Mal, Saffron does a little wiggle-shimmy-bump-and-grind.
MAL: Saffron, you even think about playing me again I will riddle you with holes.
SAFFRON: Everybody plays each other. That's all anybody ever does. We play parts.
MAL: You got all kinds of learnin' and you made me look the fool without tryin', and yet here I am with a gun to your head. That's 'cause I got people with me. People who trust each other, who do for each other, and ain't always lookin' for the advantage.
SAFFRON: Promise me you're gonna kill me soon.
MAL: Aw, you already know I ain't gonna.
SAFFRON: You know, you did pretty well. Most men... they're on me inside of ten minutes. Not tryin' to teach me to be strong and the like.
MAL: I got one question for you. Just one thing I'd like to know, straight up.
SAFFRON: Ask me.
MAL: What's your middle name? Saffron stares at him for a moment -- 
it's not what she expected. Then, as she's about to reply, Mal knocks her out.
MAL: You'd have only lied, anyhow.

INT. SERENITY - INARA'S SHUTTLE
A knock sounds on Inara's door.
INARA: Come in.
MAL: (entering) Back on course. Be on Beaumonde a day or two late. Hope that's all right.
INARA: Should be fine, thank you. And does the vixen live?
MAL: Yeah, if you can call it that. All's well, I suppose.
INARA: Yes.
MAL: You're a very graceful woman, Inara.
INARA: (startled) I -- (beat) Thank you.
MAL: So here's where I'm fuzzy. You got by that girl, came and found me. And somehow you happened to just trip and fall.
INARA: What do you mean?
MAL: How's about we don't play. You didn't just trip, did you?
INARA: No.
Hold on that -- it's an intense moment. They're standing close, tension thrumming...
Then, a big smile breaks over Mal's face.
MAL: Isn't that something. (beat) I knew you let her kiss you.
Mal leaves Inara's shuttle, grinning as big as all get out. Inara stares at his back as he leaves, blinking in disbelief.


INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
KAYLEE and SIMON are standing on opposite sides of a corridor, talking.
KAYLEE: Come on, admit it, it's true.
SIMON: No, I won't, because it's not. I use swear words like anybody else.
KAYLEE: Oh, really? See, I never heard you. So when is it you do all of this cussin'? After I go to bed, or...
SIMON: I swear when it's appropriate.
KAYLEE: Simon, the whole point of swearing is that it ain't appropriate.
KAYLEE, smiling widely, turns to see Inara crossing the cargo bay and climbing up the stairs toward her shuttle.
KAYLEE: Hey, there, Inara! Heading off for some glamorous romance?
INARA: (chuckles) Lets hope so. See you two tomorrow. Don't let Mal get you into too much trouble while I'm gone.
KAYLEE: Bye, now. Have good sex.
INARA goes up the stairs.
KAYLEE: (re: Simon's look) What?
Crashing noise off-screen. Cut to Jayne in the infirmary, which is a shambles. He has tape around his midsection. Kaylee and Simon walk into infirmary.
SIMON: Oh!
KAYLEE: Now, this would be the perfect time for a swear word.
SIMON: What...happened in here?
JAYNE: Needed to find some tape.
SIMON: So you had to tear my infirmary apart?
JAYNE: Apparently.
SIMON: My god -- you're like a trained ape. Without the training.
Mal enters, sees the gun Jayne is strapping to his belly.
MAL: Jayne. I told you we're setting down at the Canton factory settlement on Higgins' moon.
JAYNE: Yep. That you did.
MAL: Canton don't allow guns in their town
JAYNE: Yes sir. That's why I ain't strapping one to my hip.
MAL: No. That's why you ain't strapping one anywhere.
JAYNE: Oh, listen, Mal -- I was in Canton a few years back, I might have made me a few enemies thereabouts.
SIMON: Enemies? You? No, how can it be?
JAYNE: I just don't like the idea of us going in there empty-handed is all.
MAL: Why are you still arguing what's been decided?
JAYNE looks at MAL, sighs, rips tape off his belly. Whimpers.

INARA: Thanks, Wash. Disengaging in three, two, one.
Shuttle disengages, Firefly lands on Higgins' moon. Crew gets out.
SIMON: Canton really...stinks. 
MAL: That's what makes it such a great drop point. No one comes here that doesn't have to.
WASH: I vote we do this job really, really fast.
MAL: Kessler's our man. He's holding the goods we're to deliver. We go in, make contact. Easy peasy. Zoe, you're holding down the fort. Call ahead to Bernoulli, let him know we'll have his merchandise end of the week.
WASH: Don't I usually stay with the ship?
ZOE: I outrank you. (kisses WASH) Have fun.
SIMON: So, this is a place where they... they make mud.
KAYLEE: Yep. Clay really. You'd be surprised how many things it ends up in. Serenity's got more than a few ceramic parts in her.
SIMON: Really?
KAYLEE: Yeah.
SIMON: Huh.
KAYLEE: Captain, don't you think Simon should come with us?
SIMON: What? Oh, Kaylee, I don't--I don't think that...
BOOK: You go on, boy. See the sights. I can watch over your sister. I believe we've been developing a rapport.
SIMON: I--I don't know, River can be...
BOOK: Go on. I'm a Shepherd, after all. I should be able to keep my eye on a flock of one.
MAL: I'm not going that far, Doctor, and you might maybe make yourself useful.
JAYNE: Come again?
JAYNE is clearly wearing a disguise -- hood, goggles.
MAL: The management here don't take kindly to sight-seers, which is why we're... (Notices JAYNE's getup) ...posing as buyers. There ain't a one of us looks the part more than the good Doctor. I mean, the pretty fits, soft hands, definitely a moneyed individual. All rich and lily-white, pasty all over...
SIMON: All right. Fine. I'll go. Just stop describing me.
MAL: (salutes) You're the boss, boss.
JAYNE: He's the boss now? Day keeps getting better and better.
Crew walks off, toward town.

EXT. PLANET - MUD PITS - DAY
FOREMAN: Area's employees only! You best be getting back to the landing unless you have business here!
SIMON: Yes. Yes, I, I'm looking. To buy some mud.
FOREMAN: Well, then. (chuckles) Come to the right place!
He claps SIMON on the shoulder, leaving a muddy handprint, and walks off, the crew following.
FOREMAN: Of course we can handle any volume here. We have over 2,000 workers, mostly indentured. We pay them next to nothing, that way we can pass the savings directly on to you, the customer.
SIMON: Savings? Uh, excellent. That's, uh, because, as I -- as I said before, I'm going to, um, I'm going to be needing quite a bit of it. I, uh, I-I'm a buyer.
FOREMAN: Yup, best of its kind. Uh, we mix it, we brick it raw, right here on the premises. Uh, you add the right catalyst, you kiln it proper, this stuff's ten times stronger than steel at half the weight.
SIMON: Yes. Uh, I - I've heard, uh, great things, about the mud
WASH: (to Kaylee) What happened to Simon? Who is this diabolical master of disguise?
KAYLEE: He's learning.
MAL: Excuse me, boss? I'm sure the foreman has things need attending. Why don't we wander a bit, take a look at the operation, then you can figure on whether we get an account here.
SIMON: Yes? Yes. Yes, we'll, uh, we'll wander a bit.
FOREMAN: Fair enough. Come and see me when you're through.
The Foreman walks out of frame.
MAL: All right, let's head to worker-town. Find our man Kessler, get this job done.
(Crew walks off)
JAYNE: Boy's going to get us killed. Let's just do this deal and get.
MAL: His disguise ain't half as funny as yours. Who're you supposed to be, anyway?
WASH: You haven't been here in years, Jayne. You really think you need that getup? No one's going to remember you.
MAL: I think it's possible they might.
(CUT TO: Ceramic statue of JAYNE. Legend: JAYNE COBB. Long beat while they all take this in.)
SIMON: Son of a bitch.


EXT. PLANET - WORKER-TOWN - DAY
Right where we left off, with the crew staring at Jayne's statue.
MAL: Jayne?
JAYNE: Yeah?
MAL: You want to tell me how come there's a statue of you here looking at me like I owe him something?
JAYNE: Wishing I could, Captain.
MAL: No, seriously, Jayne, you want to tell me?
JAYNE: Look, Mal, I got no ruttin' idea. I was here a few years back, like I said. Pulled a second-story, stole a lot of scratch from the magistrate up on the hill. But things went way South. I had to hightail it. They don't...put you on a pedestal in town square for that.
MAL: Yeah, except I'm looking at some fair compelling evidence says they do.
SIMON: This must be what going mad feels like.
WASH: I think they captured him, though - you know...captured his essence.
KAYLEE: Looks sort of angry, don't he?
WASH: That's kinda what I meant.
A whistle sounds in the b.g.
FOREMAN: Shift four on duty. Shift four on duty.
JAYNE: Oh hey, I got an idea. Instead of us hanging around playing art critic till I get pinched by the Man, how's about we move away from this eerie-ass piece of work and get on with our increasingly eerie-ass day, how's that?
MAL: I don't know. This here's a spectacle might warrant a moment's consideration.
KAYLEE: Everywhere I go, his eyes keep following me.
JAYNE: Come on, gorram it. We got a job. Let's go do it, get the hell out of here. I crossed the magistrate of this company town, understand? He ain't exactly a forgiving sort of guy.

EXT. PLANET - MAGISTRATE'S HOUSE
INARA: Magistrate Higgins, I presume?
HIGGINS: You may, but I only make the people I own use my title. "Mister Higgins" will do fine.
(kisses her hand)
INARA: And you can call me Inara, Mr. Higgins.
HIGGINS: It's a rare pleasure, your visit to my little moon. Journey wasn't too taxing?
INARA: Not at all. I'm refreshed and ready. Shall we begin at, say, 7:30?
HIGGINS: Perfect. I have a feeling it will take all your arts to deal with this particular problem.
INARA: Every problem, Mr. Higgins, is an opportunity in disguise.
HIGGINS points at INARA, walks away

INT. SERENITY - KITCHEN AREA
Inara sits at the kitchen table. Book enters.
BOOK: What are we up to, sweetheart?
RIVER: Fixing your Bible.
BOOK: I, um, what?
RIVER: Bible's broken. Contradictions, false logistics - doesn't make sense.
She's marked up the bible, with crossed-out passages
BOOK: No, no. You - you can't...
RIVER: So we'll integrate non-progressional evolution theory with God's creation of Eden. 11 inherent metaphoric parallels already there. Eleven. Important number. Prime number. One goes into the house of 11 11 times, but always comes out one. Noah's ark is a problem.
BOOK: Really?
RIVER: We'll have to call it "early quantum state phenomenon." Only way to fit 5000 species of mammal on the same boat. 
(rips out page)
BOOK: Give me that. River, you don't...fix the Bible.
RIVER: It's broken. Doesn't make sense.
BOOK: It's not about making sense. It's about believing in something and letting that belief be real enough to change your life. It's about faith. You don't fix faith, River. It fixes you. (tries to take Bible pages from River; fails) You hang on to those, now.

INT. WORKER-TOWN - MUDDER BAR
Crew sitting around table. A busker is strumming a guitar in the center of the room.
JAYNE: Can't be a statue of me. No reason for it. Flies in the face of every kind of sense.
MAL: Won't argue with that.
WASH gags, spits out what he's just drunk.
WASH: (Chinese) [zhe shi she me lan dong xi? - "What kind of rotten food is this"?]
JAYNE: Mm-hmm. They call it "Mudder's milk." (WASH gags) All the protein, vitamins, and carbs of your grandma's best turkey dinner, plus 15% alcohol.
WASH: It's horrific.
SIMON: Well, it worked for the Egyptians.
JAYNE: What's that?
SIMON: The ancient Egyptians, back on Earth-That-Was. Not so different from the ancestral form of beer they fed the slaves to build their pyramids. It's liquid bread. Kept them from starving and knocked them out at night so they wouldn't be inclined to insurrection.
KAYLEE: Wow, Simon. That was so...historical.
MAL: (spots Well-Dressed Man; to himself) What's a gussied-up fellow like you doing in a place like this?
JAYNE: (to staring boy) Shake your head, boy. Your eyes are stuck. Git!
The staring boy jumps and runs away.
WELL-DRESSED_MAN: You wouldn't be looking for Kessler?
MAL: Just having a brew
WELL-DRESSED_MAN: I knew a Kessler.
MAL: "Knew?"
WELL-DRESSED_MAN: He was a good middleman. Low profile. Didn't filch. Last week, the factory foreman and his prod crew heard he was moving contraband through town. Gave him a peck of trouble for it.
MAL: What kind of peck was that?
WELL-DRESSED_MAN: The kind where they hacked off his hands and feet with a machete, rolled him into the bog.
WASH: They peck pretty hard around here.
MAL: Listen, my client offworld is waiting for his delivery. If the goods are gone...
WELL-DRESSED_MAN: Not to worry. Your man's merchandise is here, safe in Kessler's hiding place. We just got to figure out how to get it across town without being seen by the foreman and his prods. I advise we all just lay low for a moment.
WELL-DRESSED_MAN leaves
BUSKER starts to sing.
JAYNE: (Chinese) [Yeh-soo ta ma duh.]
BUSKER: Jayne \ The man we call Jayne \ He robbed from the rich and he gave to the poor \ Stood up to the Man and he gave him what for \ Our love for him now ain't hard to explain \ The Hero of Canton, the man they call Jayne \ Our Jayne saw the Mudders' backs breaking \ He saw the Mudders lament \ And he saw the magistrate taking \ Every dollar and leaving five cents \ So he said, "You can't do that to my people" \ He said...
(singing continues)
MAL: (over singing) Um...Jayne?
JAYNE: Yeah, Mal?
MAL: You got any light you'd like to shed on this development?
JAYNE: No, Mal.
SIMON: No. This must be what going mad feels like.
Singing continues
MUDDERS: Our love for him now ain't hard to explain \ The Hero of Canton, the man they call Jayne
BUSKER: Now here is what separates heroes \ From common folk like you and I \ The man they call Jayne \ He turned 'round his plane \ And let that money hit the sky
JAYNE: Ohhh, I'll be gorrammed. That's where that cash went. I stole that money from Higgins just like the song says, lifted me one of his hovercraft. But I got tagged by anti-aircraft, started losing altitude. Had dump them strongboxes to stay airborne. Oh...60,000, untraceable. And I drop it right square in the middle of mud-farmer central.
WASH: We gotta go to the crappy town where I'm the hero!
MUDDERS: (singing) The man they call Jayne!

INT. SERENITY - BOOK'S ROOM
BOOK loosens his hair and washes his face, getting ready for bed.
RIVER: Hello?
BOOK: In here, River
RIVER: I'm...I tore these out of your symbol and they turned into paper. But I want to put them back, so...
BOOK stands up from washing his face. His hair is out of it's usual ponytail. He looks like Albert Einstein after sticking his finger in a light socket.
BOOK: I'm sorry, what's that?
RIVER screams, runs away.
BOOK: River? River, come back
ZOE: Preacher, what the hell did you sic on... (sees him) Woah! Oh.

INT. WORKER-TOWN - MUDDER BAR
The singing has finally stopped.
JAYNE: Captain, now they're off the subject of me, shouldn't we be getting the hell out of here?
MAL: I'd say that's a reasonable request, considering the circumstances.
JAYNE: Ruttin' mudders.
All get up from the table, walk our of bar. To crowd of MUDDERS, who cheer:
MUDDERS: JAYNE!! (chanting) Jayne Jayne Jayne Jayne Jayne Jayne Jayne!
JAYNE runs back into bar.
JAYNE: Gimme some milk. The bartender gives Jayne a jar. Jayne drinks
MUDDER_MAN: Don't you understand? He's come back! It's Jayne!
The Bartender swipes milk bottle from Jayne's hand.
JAYNE: What the..?!
BARTENDER: Hero of Canton won't be drinking that [chou ma niao - "stinking horse piss"]. He drinks the best whiskey in the house!
MUDDERS cheer. MAL re-enters bar.
WELL-DRESSED_MAN: What the hell's going on? This how people lay low where you're from?
MAL: Not generally, no.
WELL-DRESSED_MAN: Listen, friend. I came here to make sure a deal went down solid, not to get chopped up by the Canton prod crew and fed to the bog.
MAL: I understand your concerns, friend. This here's all part of our new plan.
MAL smiles, WELL-DRESSED MAN walks off. Rest of crew has returned to bar.
KAYLEE: Captain, how exactly is this part...?
MAL: Still working the details.


INT. INARA'S SHUTTLE
She's lighting candles, making tea. HIGGINS enters, a young man behind him.
HIGGINS: Inara, allow me to introduce my son, Fess Higgins.
INARA: Hello, Fess. Mr. Higgins, this shuttle is a place of union. I'm sure you can appreciate...
HIGGINS: What is this? I brought you here to bed my son, not throw him a tea party.
INARA: Sir, the Companion Greeting Ceremony is a ritual with centuries of tradition...
HIGGINS: My son is 26 years old and he ain't yet a man. Twenty-six. And since he can't find a willin' woman himself...
INARA: Mr. Higgins, you're not allowed here.
HIGGINS: What?
INARA: As I've said, this room is a consecrated place of union. Only your son belongs here.
HIGGINS: Well, I'm...
INARA: Now, why don't you go on, and let us begin our work.
HIGGINS: Now listen here, young lady...
INARA: Good night, Mr. Higgins.
HIGGINS leaves. INARA continues, turning to FESS.
INARA: Well, that's a bit more peaceful. Will you sit?

INT. WORKER-TOWN - MUDDER BAR
MUDDERS: To Jayne! To Jayne!
JAYNE: To me!
They drink. More cheering.
JAYNE: To the Mudders!
MUDDERS: To the Mudders!
Cheering continues.
MAL and WASH are sitting at a table nearby. A little ways away, KAYLEE and SIMON sit close together.
SIMON: (drunkenly) You know, I've saved lives. Dozens. Maybe hundreds. I reattached a girl's leg. Her whole leg. She named her hamster after me. I got a hamster. He drops a box of money, he gets a town.
KAYLEE: Hamsters is nice.
SIMON: To Jayne! The box-dropping, man-ape-gone-wrong-thing.
KAYLEE: (laughs) You are pretty funny.
SIMON: And you're pretty....pretty.
KAYLEE: What did you just say?
SIMON: I just said that you're pretty. Even when you're covered in...engine grease, you're... No, especially, especially when you're covered in engine grease.
MAL interrupts.
MAL: It's time to get out of this nuthouse. Got some planning to work out.
KAYLEE: Now, Captain? Things are going so well.
MAL: I suppose. Jayne's certainly feeling better about life, but...
KAYLEE: I said, things are going well. (meaningful look)
MAL: Oh, "well." (looks at SIMON) Well, I tell you what. Jayne is stuck here with his adoring masses - why don't you and Simon hang around and keep an eye on him for me.
They toast, MAL walks off. KAYLEE smiles at SIMON

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
BOOK is looking into RIVER's hiding place under the Cargo Bay stairs.
RIVER: (O.S.) They say the snow on the roof was too heavy. They say the ceiling will cave in. His brains are in terrible danger.
BOOK: River? Why don't you come out?
RIVER: No! I can't. Too much hair.
ZOE chuckles
BOOK: Is that it?
ZOE: Hell, yes, Preacher. If I didn't have stuff to get done, I'd be in there with her.
BOOK: It's the rules of my order. Like the book. It symbolizes...
ZOE: Uh huh. River, honey? He's putting the hair away now.
RIVER: It'll still be there....waiting.
Mal and Wash enter the cargo bay.
WASH: Honey, we're home!
ZOE: Where you guys been? Mal, Bernoulli's chomping at the bit. Says he wants his merchandise yesterday.
MAL: Yeah, well, we still got a few wrinkles to work out on the deal.
WASH: Did you know that Jayne is a bona fide folk hero? Got a song and everything.
ZOE: What? You been drinking, husband.
MAL: That he has. Don't make it any less the case.
ZOE: You telling me that Jayne...
MAL: It's true. True enough -- We can use it, anyway. We talked a few pillars of the Mudder community into having a little Jayne Day celebration in town square tomorrow.
WASH cracks up, laughing
MAL: It should buy us enough of a distraction to get the stolen goods out from under the foreman and his crew of prods.
ZOE: (to Wash) You're really going to have to start again. Jayne's a what?

INT. INARA'S SHUTTLE
Fess and Inara are sitting next to each other, taking tea.
FESS: This whole thing, uh...it, it is embarrassing. My father's right again, I guess. And to have to bring you here, and... 
INARA: Your father's not right, Fess. It's not embarrassing to be virgin. It's simply one state of being. As far as bringing me here, Companions choose the people they're to be with very carefully. For example, if your father had asked me to come here for him, I wouldn't have.
FESS: Really?
INARA: Really, Fess. You're different from him. The more you accept that, the stronger you'll become.
INARA takes off FESS'S glasses, kisses him.

INT. WORKER-TOWN - MUDDER BAR
JAYNE: So, the magistrate, he let you folks keep all that cash?
MUDDER_MAN: He did. And it pained him, that's for dead sure. When he found out, he sent his prods in to take it back from us, but the workers resisted.
JAYNE: Fought the law, huh?
MUDDER_MAN: If the Mudders are together on a thing, there's too many of us to be put down. So in the end, he just called it a bonus.
JAYNE: That's one hell of a bonus.
MUDDER_MAN: And then, when we put that statue of you in town square, he rolled in, wanted to tear it down. But the whole town rioted.
JAYNE: You guys had a riot? On account of me? A real riot?
MUDDER_MAN: I can't believe you're back.
JAYNE: How could I stay away?
JAYNE hugs the MUDDERS closest to him.

INT. MAGISTRATE HIGGIN'S HOUSE
Magistrate Higgins is pouring himself a drink when the Foreman enters.
FOREMAN: Magistrate Higgins...
HIGGINS: My son's out there I pray to God losing his cherry.
FOREMAN: There's a problem in worker-town, sir. Jayne Cobb's come back.

EXT. PLANET - MUD PITS
The Foreman and Magistrate Higgins stand outside what appears to be a storage area. FOREMAN knocks on what looks like a storage shed, unlocks it, opens the door.
HIGGINS: Evenin', Stitch.
STITCH: (inside dark cell) What do you want with me?
HIGGINS: Nothing. Done your time, you paid your debt. It's time you were on your way.
STITCH comes out of the cell. He's missing one eye, has wild hair and beard. He has trouble standing. HIGGINS hands him a bag.
HIGGINS: Here.... I believe these were your personal effects.
STITCH: You keep me in that box four years, you give me a loaded gun?
HIGGINS: You got the urge to use it, no doubt. But I'm not the one who brought you in on that robbery. I'm not the one who partnered up with you and then turned on you when his plan went South. How high up was that Shuttle when he pushed you out? 30 feet? Jayne Cobb cost you four years of your life plus a perfectly good eyeball. But here's the poetical portion - he's back in town. This very day. Best of luck in your new life.
HIGGINS walks off. STITCH cocks his shotgun.


EXT. WORKER-TOWN - SQUARE - DAY
(Establishing shot.)

INT. WORKER-TOWN - MUDDER BAR - DAY
KAYLEE and SIMON asleep together on bench. MAL approaches.
KAYLEE: (sleepily) Hey, Captain. (wakes up more; sits up) Captain!
SIMON: Hey...Mal, uh, Mal... No, nuh-nuh-nothing happened. No, there was, uh, there was some drinking, but, uh, we, no we certainly didn't. No, I would never ! Not with Kaylee...
KAYLEE: What do you mean, Not with me?
MAL: Yeah, uh-huh. Where's my hero?
Jayne enters from upstairs, his arm around a woman, and walks down to the bar area.
JAYNE: (singing) My love for me now ain't hard to explain, The Hero of Canton, The man they call...ME
JAYNE: (speaking, now) Eggs. The living legend needs eggs. Or maybe another milk. 
MAL: No, the living legend needs to come with us. He's got a little appearance to make.
JAYNE: He does?
MAL: That's right This job here's gone way past long enough.
JAYNE: Yeah, all right. (To woman) Well, you go on now, I've got me important hero-type stuff to do.
MAL gathers his crew and begins to walk off.
KAYLEE: (to Simon) Where you going?
SIMON: I'm going with you.
KAYLEE: Mmm, I don't think so. No, maybe you ought to stay here. It's about the time for a civilized person to have his breakfast. That's the sort of thing would be appropriate, don't you think?
SIMON gapes. Rest of crew leaves.
SIMON: (sighs; to Bartender) Excuse me, could I see a menu?
BARTENDER: A what?

INT. INARA'S SHUTTLE.
INARA and FESS are curled up in bed, post-coital.
INARA: You're very quiet
FESS: I'm sorry. I just...I just thought I'd feel... different...after. Aren't I supposed to be a man now?
INARA: A man is just a boy who's old enough to ask that question. Our time together....It's a ritual, a symbol. It means something to your father. I hope it was not entirely forgettable for you.
FESS: No, it was..
INARA: But it doesn't make you a man. You do that yourself.
Suddenly there is a loud banging on door
HIGGINS: Fess! Fess Higgins! Get out here!

EXT. WORKER-TOWN - STREET - DAY
MAL: So, that's where the little "Jayne Celebration" we got planned comes in. Should give us enough time to get the goods back onto Serenity.
JAYNE: I don't know. You think we should be using my fame to hoodwink folks?
MAL: You better laugh when you say that.
JAYNE: No really, Mal, I mean, maybe there's something to this. The Mudders? I think I really made a difference in their lives. You know -- Me, Jayne Cobb.
MAL: I know your name, jackass.
JAYNE: You know, they threw a riot on my account? A riot...
WASH and ZOE ride up on a four-wheel.
WASH: Morning, kids!
ZOE: Is that Jayne? Is that really him? Wash, pinch me, I must be dreaming!
JAYNE: Oh hell, I'll pinch you!
MAL: Just get on over to town square, Jayne. Your fans are waiting.
WASH, ZOE, MAL and KAYLEE ride off, to a sparsely forested area.
ZOE: Do you really think we can get this stuff cross town without being noticed?
MAL: Got to find it first. Here we go.
(Camera pans down to reveal that the hill they are standing on is built over a large parcel.)
MAL: Let's get it dug up.

INT. INARA'S SHUTTLE
Fess is dressed. Inara is wearing a loose robe and pouring more tea.
INARA: A criminal hearing?
FESS: Yeah, my father's ordered me to attend. You see, there's this man, uh...It happened when I was growing up here. He stole a ton of money from my dad, gave it to the poor, to my father's workers. He's become kind of folk hero in Canton.
INARA: Go on
FESS: Well, he's back, apparently. He landed here yesterday.
INARA: Yesterday. Oh, no. I - I know this man. He just has this idiotic sense of nobility, you know? He can never just let things go. He thinks he's this hard-hearted criminal, and he can be unrelenting... but there's a side to him that's just so...
FESS: You mean you actually know Jayne?
INARA: Jayne? Jayne Cobb? You're talking about Jayne Cobb?
FESS: Yes, Jayne Cobb. The Hero of Canton. The only person I ever saw who stood up to my father.
INARA: I... (flabbergasted)
FESS: My dad had him traced back to his ship. He had Port Control put a land-lock on it. Jayne will get back and find out that he's grounded. I sort of hate the idea of his getting caught.
INARA: Yes, that would be bad.

INT. WORKER-TOWN - MUDDER BAR - DAY
Simon examines the gruel he was served for breakfast.
SIMON: (clears throat) Could I just get the...the check...please...
Door opens, STITCH enters.
STITCH: Heard tell you run with Jayne Cobb.
SIMON: Excuse me?
STITCH: You going to take me to that dirty, low-down shingle of a man?
SIMON: Listen, uh, sir... I don't know who...
STITCH grabs SIMON, lifts him out of his seat, punches him.
STITCH: Sir?! Look at me you pantywaist idiot! (Kicks SIMON) I just spent the last four years steaming in a hot-box and you're Sir-ing me?
STITCH: (kicks him again). The folks say you're part of Jayne's team, so...
STITCH: (picks Simon up; slams him against wall) So, where is that no-good reptile hiding hisself?
STITCH: (takes out knife; holds it to SIMON's throat) Tell me, boy, or I'll cut off every last bit of them good looks!
SIMON reaches for a bottle on the ground, crashes it on STITCH's head. STITCH cuts SIMON on his forearm, knocks him back to the ground.
STITCH: Ohh, not done yet, young'un. (Picks up SIMON) That's going to cost you an eye.
MUDDERS:  (O.S.) (outside chanting) Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne!
STITCH: Come on!
STITCH drags SIMON outside the bar.

EXT. WORKER-TOWN - SQUARE - DAY
The crew of Serenity rides up on loaded four-wheel.
WASH: They love their boy.
MAL: Just drive by now, nice and slow.
MUDDERS: (chanting) Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne!
PROD: Come on, sir. Let's just get...
FOREMAN: Magistrate says no. We hold position. Understand me?

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
MAL: Zoe, pack down the cargo. Wash, you heat up Serenity. We're blowing this mess inside half an hour.
WASH: Already there.
MAL: (to KAYLEE) Let's go get our wayward babes.

EXT. WORKER-TOWN - SQUARE - DAY
MUDDERS: (chanting) Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne!
Jayne walks through the crowd and stands in front of his statue.
MUDDERS: Speech! Speech!
JAYNE: Uh...I'm no good with words. Don't...don't use 'em much, myself. (crowd chuckles) But I want to thank you all for being here, and for thinking so much of me... Far as I see it, you people been given the shortest end of the stick ever been offered a human soul in this crap-hill 'verse....But you took that end... well, you took it. And that's... well, I guess that's something.
MUDDERS cheer.
KAYLEE: Wow. That didn't sound half-bad.
MAL: I'm shocked my own self.
STITCH shoots off shotgun, the crowd parts to reveal Stitch holding a beaten Simon.
JAYNE: Stitch Hessian...
STITCH: (chuckles) Well, hey there, Jayne. Thought I'd make you watch while I butchered me one of your boys.
JAYNE: He ain't a one of mine. Where you been hiding? You gone and got yourself looking mighty hideous.
STITCH: (laughs) Yeah...
FOREMAN: (to Prod) Now Jayne gets his.
KAYLEE approaches SIMON, who is face-down on the ground.
KAYLEE: Oh, honey...
SIMON: Kaylee?
She helps him up.
STITCH: So, what's this about a "Hero of Canton?" Was I hearing that right? Four years of lock-down plays tricks on the ear.
JAYNE: I ain't a hero, Stitch. Just a working stiff like you.
STITCH: (laughs) Yep, he's right. Jayne is. We used to work together, he and I. (pulls gun on MAL, who has been approaching) Now why don't you just let ol' Stitch speak his piece?
MAL: Go on, then.
STITCH: Whole lot of money in a Magistrate's safe, weren't there, Jayne? Got away clean, too! But then our plane took a hit, and we're going down. We dumped the fuel reserve, dumped the life support, hell, we even dumped the seats! The, there's Jayne, the money, and me. And there was no way he was going to drop that money.
MUDDER MAN: He did. He dropped it on the Mudders.
STITCH: By accident, you in-bred dung-head! He tossed me out first! For six months, we run together, he turned me out before I could scream!
JAYNE: You'd have done the same.
STITCH: No, never. You protect the man you're with. You watch his back. Everybody knows that! Well, except the Hero of Canton.
JAYNE: You gonna talk me to death, buddy? Is that the plan?
STITCH: This is the plan.
STITCH aims his gun, fires at JAYNE. The MUDDER MAN who has been shadowing Jayne the whole episode dives between JAYNE and the bullet. Crowd screams.


EXT. WORKER-TOWN - SQUARE - DAY
The MUDDER MAN lies dead in front of JAYNE. JAYNE throws his knife at STITCH, then charges him. They fight. JAYNE slams STITCH into the ground. Crowd watches. JAYNE notices the MUDDER MAN on the ground.
JAYNE: Get up...get up, you stupid piece of... (rolls MUDDER over; he's dead) What did you do that for? What's wrong with you? Didn't you hear a word he said?
MUDDER BOY approaches STITCH's body, removes JAYNE's knife.
JAYNE: All of you! You think there's someone just going to drop money on you?! Money they could use?! Well, there ain't people like that. There's just people like me.
BOY approaches JAYNE, presents knife. JAYNE slaps knife out of BOY's hands. Turns, goes to Jayne statue, topples it.

EXT. PLANET - SERENITY AIRLOCK
Crew boards ship, KAYLEE helping SIMON walk, JAYNE's hands bloody.
MAL: (on comm) Wash, we're on. Get us the hell off of this mud ball.
WASH: Uh, yeah, I'm working on it.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Wash is frantically pushing buttons, trying to get the ship started. He sees the ship is land-locked on a small display.
WASH: (Chinese) [Goo yong jong dun goo yang.]
INARA: (entering) Hello, Wash. Has there been a problem with takeoff?
WASH: Is there a problem! Is there a problem?!? (sees "Land-Lock released" on screen) No. We're fine.
INARA smiles.

INT. MAGISTRATE HIGGINS'S HOUSE
HIGGINS: You did what?!?
FESS: I sent an override to Port Control. Lifted the land-lock on Serenity.
HIGGINS: I ought to wipe that smile off your head. How dare you defy me?
FESS: You wanted to make a man out of me, Dad. I guess it worked.

INT. SERENITY - CATWALK
JAYNE leans on the catwalk railing, looking at the knife he used to kill Stitch.

INT. SERENITY - KITCHEN AREA
RIVER is looking at Bible, BOOK approaches.
RIVER: Just keep walking, preacher-man.

INT. SERENITY - SIMON'S ROOM
Kaylee is patching up the good doctor.
KAYLEE: You got to be steely. You can't be letting men stomp on you so much
SIMON: It wasn't exactly a plan...
KAYLEE: You ain't weak. You couldn't beat them back? Or would that not be appropriate?
SIMON: You're never letting go of that, are you?
KAYLEE: Well, you confound me some, is all. I mean, you like me well enough, and we get along... and then you go all stiff.
SIMON: (stiffens) I'm, I'm not, um, I didn't...
KAYLEE: See! You're doing it right now! What's so damn important about being proper? It don't mean nothing out here in the black.
SIMON: It means more out here. It's all I have. I mean... My way of being polite, or however it's...well, it's the only way I have of showing you that I like you. I'm showing respect.
KAYLEE: So, when we made love last night...
SIMON: When we WHAT?
KAYLEE: You really are such an easy mark.

INT. SERENITY - CATWALK
Mal joins Jayne on the catwalk, leaning on the railing.
JAYNE: Don't make no sense. What...Why the hell did that Mudder have to go and do that for, Mal? Jumping in front of that shotgun blast. Hell, there weren't a one of them understood what happened out there. They're probably sticking that statue right back up.
MAL: Most like.
JAYNE: I don't know why that eats at me so.
MAL: It's my estimation that...every man ever got a statue made of him, was one kind of sumbitch or another. Ain't about you, Jayne. About what they need.
JAYNE: Don't make no sense.


EXT. SPACE
Serenity motionless in space. No lights. No movement. No people.

INT. SERENITY - UPPER DECKS
(Various shots of the ship.)
The cockpit: empty.
The upper decks: empty.
The kitchen area is empty of people, but dishes and food still clutter the table.
The engine room. The entrance and walls are scorched. The big turbine isn't turning.

INT. SERENITY - BELOW DECKS
All the loose contents of the ship look like they've been tossed, bins and boxes and clutter strewn everyone. Still no one in sight.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
More debris. More strewn cargo. Then,
MAL falls into frame, landing hard on the cargo bay floor. Pale and sweaty. And alone. He's obviously in extreme pain, struggling to stay conscious. As the camera PUSHES IN on his face, we start to HEAR VOICES:
SALESMAN: (V.O.) A real beauty, ain't she? Yes, sir. A right smart purchase, this vessel. Tell you what, you buy this ship, treat her proper, she'll be with ya for the rest of your life.
Then the SOUND of the AIRLOCK DOORS opening. LIGHT hits him in the face, blinding him.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - FLASHBACK
THE AIRLOCK DOORS open, revealing two FIGURES, SILHOUETTED by sunlight, BLUE SKY behind them.
The figures step onto the ship -- and now we see that it's MAL and ZOE. They enter the cargo bay.
The cargo bay itself is now totally empty. Everything is covered with a thick layer of dust.
MAL: Well?
ZOE: (looking) You paid money for this, sir? On purpose?
MAL: What? Come on, seriously, Zoe. Whaddya think?
ZOE: Honestly, sir. I think you got robbed.
MAL: Robbed? What, no. What do you mean?
ZOE: It's a piece of [fei-oo. - "junk".]
MAL: [Fei-oo? - "Junk?"] Okay. She won't be winning any beauty contests anytime soon. But she is solid. Ship like this, be with ya 'til the day you die.
ZOE: 'Cause it's a deathtrap.
MAL: That's not... you are very much lacking in imagination.
ZOE: I imagine that's so, sir.
MAL: C'mon. You ain't even seen most of it. I'll show you the rest. (as they go) And try to see past what she is, and on to what she can be.
ZOE: What's that, sir?
MAL: Freedom, is what.
ZOE: (pointing) No, I meant what's that?
He looks down.
MAL: Oh. Yeah. Just step around it. I think something must've been living in here.
As they move off...
MAL: I tell ya, Zoe, we find ourselves a mechanic, get her running again. Hire a good pilot. Maybe even a cook. Live like real people. Small crew, them as feel the need to be free. Take jobs as they come -- and we'll never be under the heel of nobody ever again. No matter how long the arm of the Alliance might get, we'll just get ourselves a little further.
ZOE: Get her running again?
MAL: Yeah.
ZOE: So not running now?
MAL: Not so much.
ZOE: Ah.
MAL: But she will.
He moves deeper into the ship. She follows. The camera doesn't.
MAL: I already know what I'm gonna call her. Got a named all picked out...
That last bit trailing off as their footsteps recede and their voices fade.
(As the LAUGHTER echoes and fades, CAMERA MOVES DOWN to a TIGHT FACE in the f.g.)
Mal, back in the present day, curled up on the cargo bay floor, wincing in pain.
(Camera MOVES DOWN through the floor, to REVEAL that Mal is lying on top of a grate. A thick drop of Mal's blood drips through the grating.)


INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
Mal on the cargo bay floor. He struggles, forces himself to rise with great gasping and obvious pain. He grabs an engine part that's sitting next to him on the floor, moves off slowly.

INT. SERENITY - DINING AREA
Laughter from the assembled. Gathered are: Mal, Zoe, Jayne, Kaylee, Simon, Inara and Book.
ZOE: (laughing) No! That is not true. No.
BOOK: I swear it is!
INARA: Surely one of you must have told him!
BOOK: No! Not one among the brethren had the heart to say anything. He was so proud!
LAUGHTER. Wash enters from the bridge.
WASH: What? What was he proud of? Who he?
BOOK: Looked rather natty, truth be told, you know!
Another explosion of laughter. Wash is anxious to be let in on the joke.
WASH: What was natty? (as he sits) I want to hear about the natty thing. (reaches for serving bowl) Book gets his laughter under control and takes a drink.
KAYLEE: Shepherd Book was just tellin' us funny stories about his life at the monastery.
WASH: Monastic humor. I miss out on all the fun.
WASH: (sees serving bowl is empty) And all the food, too, apparently...
ZOE: Just who do you think you're married to?
Zoe lifts a napkin off a plate piled with food.
ZOE: Voila!
WASH: I love my wife.
He kisses her.
MAL: So we got a course set?
WASH: We do. Took a little creative navigating, but we should make it all the way to Greenleaf without running afoul of any Alliance patrols. Or a single living soul, for that matter.
MAL: Good. Way it should be.
WASH: 'course, what should be an 18 hour trip's gonna take us the better part of a week by this route.
MAL: We're in no rush. I like an easy, languorous journey.
Kaylee rises, picks up some plates.
KAYLEE: Oh, gee, I wonder what that would that be like?
SIMON: (moves to assist) Let me help you with that --
KAYLEE: It's your turn.
SIMON: (clueless) My turn...?
KAYLEE: Shepherd told a funny story 'bout bein' a preacher. Now you tell a funny story about being a doctor.
SIMON: A funny story...
JAYNE: Yeah, 'cos sick people are hi-larious.
SIMON: Well, they can be... uh... (chuckles) In fact, I remember there was this one time I was working the E.R. and this, this, uh, fellow, this very upright sort of citizen, comes in complaining of...
JAYNE: (interrupts) Now Inara -- she's gotta have some real funny whorin' stories, I'd wager.
INARA: Oh! Do I ever! Funny and sexy. You have no idea.
INARA: (then) And you never will.
Zoe snorts.
INARA: I don't discuss my clients.
JAYNE: Aww, come on, Inara. Who'd know?
INARA: You. 
INARA: (then) A Companion doesn't kiss and tell.
MAL: So there is kissing?
She shoots him a look. He smiles back. He wasn't being malicious.
ZOE: Hey, doc?
He looks at her.
ZOE: (nods behind Simon toward) I think Kaylee may need your help after all.
He turns and is surprised to see her carrying aloft a ship-made birthday cake with mismatched candles.
KAYLEE: Care to make the first incision, Doctor Tam?
KAYLEE: (then) Happy birthday, Simon.
EVERYONE: (variously) Happy birthday! Yeah, many more. Happy Birthday, son.
Simon reacts, taken aback.
SIMON: Well this is... How - how did you know? 
SIMON: (glances to) River, did you -- ?
RIVER: "Day" is a vestigial mode of time measurement based on solar cycles. It's not applicable.
RIVER: (then) I didn't get you anything.
MAL: Seems a fresh warrant for your arrest come up on the cortex. Had your birth date attached right to it.
SIMON: (worried) Really?
KAYLEE: (re: the cake) Hope you like it. Couldn't get a hold of no flour, so it's mostly protein. In fact, it's pretty much what we just had for supper. But I tried to get the frosting as chocolatey tasting as possible, so...
He looks at Kaylee.
SIMON: Thank you. I'm really - I'm very deeply moved. Thank you.
JAYNE: Well deeply move yourself over there and blow out them candles so we can try a slice.
KAYLEE: Come on, Doc. Give a good blow.
He smiles, nods, leans forward, is about to blow out the candles, when something makes a bad noise deep inside the ship. A GRINDING back near the engine. The power DIMS and FLICKERS, the engine stops...
A beat. They all pause. Then the familiar HUM of the engines again.
JAYNE: What the hell was that?
KAYLEE: Maybe just a hiccup. I'll go check it out.
She sets down the cake on the counter. Starts to move off.
WASH: (rising) I'll take a look at the helm.
Now he heads off toward the bridge. River is staring at the cake.
RIVER: Fire...
Simon glances at her, then back to the cake. The candles.
SIMON: Okay, right.
He leans in to blow out the candles as --
Kaylee is stepping up to the door --
There is a huge EXPLOSION from the back of the ship, at the engine room.
Zoe is on her feet in an instant. She lunges for Kaylee as --
-- a giant BALL OF FIRE roils from the back of the ship, filling the corridor. Zoe shoves Kaylee clear of the doorway, but the FIREBALL bursts at the doorway and Zoe is knocked back hard by the concussion of the blast, her body glancing off the dinner table, then hitting a wall. Wash comes running back --
WASH: Zoe!
Everyone's disoriented. Wash flies to his wife's side. Inara and Book move to Kaylee, who was shoved out of the way.
Another FIREBALL explodes toward the kitchen area when Mal forces the big metal door shut, latches it just before it hits. He's knocked back by the blast that impacts on the other side of the closed door.
RIVER: Fire! Fire!
Mal turns, sees that Simon is already with Wash by Zoe.
WASH: Zoe, honey, talk to me -- you gotta talk to me, baby... Mal passes Jayne as he moves toward the bridge, pausing only long enough to say:
MAL: Seal off everything that leads below decks. Do it now!
Jayne moves to do that immediately. Mal runs to the bridge.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Mal works some controls on the console.

EXT. SPACE
As the ramp lowers into space.

INT. SERENITY - ENGINE ROOM
The fire rages.

INT. SERENITY - DINING AREA
Wash is panicky while Simon works on Zoe.
WASH: Is she gonna be okay?
SIMON: I need my med kit.
Simon rises, turns toward the aftdeck, sees that the door is shut.
KAYLEE: (shakes her head) Not this way. We got fire.
He turns, moves to the foredeck, steps up to --

FOREDECK DOOR
Jayne is just coming up from around the corner where he's sealed off that exit.
JAYNE: Where you think you're going?
SIMON: Zoe's badly hurt. I need my medical supplies.
JAYNE: Sorry, Doc. Nobody leaves. Everything's sealed up tight.
SIMON: If you don't let me through, she could die.
JAYNE: I let you through -- we all die.
Off this stand off,

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Mal continues to work the ship's controls.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
The AIRLOCK DOORS open.

INT. SERENITY - ENGINE ROOM
The fire is sucked down toward the lower deck, toward the vacuum of space.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
The fire goes ROARING through the cargo bay and, along with some loose cargo, is spit out into space --

EXT. SPACE
As the fire shoots out of the cargo bay, dissipating in cold space.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Mal watches through the bridge window as the fire shoots out, extinguishing itself in the vacuum.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
As the ramp closes and the air lock doors close.

INT. SERENITY - STAIRWELL
Serenity's dark. An injured MAL is stumbling down the steps toward the infirmary, engine part clutched in his hand. He opens the infirmary doors.

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY
The infirmary door is shoved open and an uninjured Mal, Wash and Jayne carry in the unconscious Zoe, place her on the examination table. Simon gets right to work.
Everyone else is close at hand, variously in the infirmary and lingering outside in the common area.

SIMON: There's no sign of burning. It must be internal. I'll have to do a scan.
WASH: Baby. Zoe, can you hear me? Zoe. Come on, sweetheart, talk to me. Zoe. Come on, talk to me. Look at me, sweet--
He starts hooking her up to his equipment. Wash at his side, concern etched on his face. Mal fades back, away from the activity there, to:

INT. SERENITY - COMMON AREA
Kaylee is hovering just outside the door of the infirmary in the common area. Mal approaches her.
MAL: Kaylee. Kaylee, look at me.
She does.
MAL: I need you up in the engine room figuring out what caused this.
KAYLEE: (feeling it) She ain't movin'.
Mal glances from Kaylee to Zoe through the glass. His attention is drawn back to Kaylee by
KAYLEE: Serenity's not movin'.
MAL: I know it. Which is why we need to suss out what it was happened so we can get her going again, right?
MAL: (she nods) Think you can do that?
KAYLEE: Yes, Cap'n.
MAL: That's a good girl.
Kaylee gathers herself, heads off. Mal turns his attention back to:

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY
Simon works on Zoe. Wash is at his wife's side, panicky.
WASH: Come on, baby. You're strong. Strongest person I've ever met. You can do this.
JAYNE: She gonna make it?
SIMON: Please. I need to work.
Mal appears at the door.
MAL: Wash.
Wash won't look away from his wife.
MAL: Wash, I need you on the bridge.
WASH: Zoe's hurt.
MAL: And the doctor's gonna do everything he can. Meantime, I gotta have you on that bridge. We need to know how bad it is.
WASH: (turning) How bad? It's bad, okay, sir? My wife may be dying, here. So my feeling is it's pretty damn bad.
MAL: Wash...
WASH: I'm not leaving her side, Mal. Don't ask me again.
MAL: (flatly) I wasn't asking. I was telling.
WASH: [Chur ni-duh. - "Screw you."]
Mal sighs. Reaches in, grabs Wash by the shirt, swings him around, shoves him up against a wall.
MAL: You're gonna get to the bridge and get us on our feet.
Beat. Mal eases off. Wash's back is now to the infirmary door.
Wash goes to the bridge, still angry and upset. Mal looks back to the faces looking back at him, then he exits, too.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - FLASHBACK
Wash's pilot's chair. Empty. CAMERA moves off that to find Wash on his back, examining the cockpit innards. His face is obscured from us.
WASH: (calmly) Yeah. This is all very do-able.
Wash slides out -- and the first thing we notice is the big moustache and the flat hair. Along with the Hawaiian shirt. He stands and now we see, outside the cockpit windows, BLUE SKY. Serenity's parked someplace on a planet.
WASH: Shouldn't be a problem at all. A few modifications, get some real maneuverability out of this boat. You'd be surprised.
Mal and Zoe stand at the cockpit door as Wash looks the vessel over.
MAL: So you'll take the job, then?
As Wash sits into the pilot's chair, gives it a little swivel.
WASH: Might do, might do. Think I'm startin' to get a feel here.
MAL: Good. Well, take your time. Make yourself to home. Just, uh fiddle with the dials, there. We'll be nearby.
Wash swivels away from them. Fiddles with dials.

MAL AND ZOE
Moving away from the cockpit, down the foredeck, toward the dining area as they confer.
MAL: He's great, ain't he?
ZOE: I don't like him.
MAL: (taken aback) What?
ZOE: Something about him bothers me.
MAL: What? What about him bothers you?
ZOE: I'm not sure. It's just... something.
MAL: Well, your "something" comes up against a list of recommendations long as my leg. Tanaka raved about the guy. Renshaw's been trying to get him on his crew for a month. And we need us a pilot.
ZOE: I understand, sir. He bothers me.
MAL: Look, we finally got ourselves a genius mechanic. It's about time we hired someone to fly the damn thing.
A BUFF BLOND GUY, BESTER, passes through frame.
BESTER: (nodding) "Genius." No one's ever called me that before. Shiny.
Zoe ignores Bester, still thinking about Wash.
ZOE: (shrugs; to Mal) Just bothers me.

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY - HEART MONITOR
Starts to BEEP an ALERT. Zoe's hooked up to the equipment now. Simon reacts.
SIMON: Her heart's stopped...

INARA, BOOK AND JAYNE
Looking on, helpless. Nervous.
BOOK: Maybe someone should get her husband down here.
MAL: No.
They see Mal has appeared. He moves into the infirmary. Simon's racing around the infirmary, grabbing things.
MAL: What do you need, doc?
As Simon chooses a vial --
SIMON: (pointing) That drawer. Right there --
Mal pulls it open. Sees a large sterile hypo.
SIMON: That's the one.
He hands it to Simon, who doses it up.
INARA: What is it?
SIMON: Pure adrenaline.
Simon readies himself, poises the needle right over Zoe's heart. Inara cringes and turns away. Simon plunges the needle in. Zoe's body JOLTS and we,

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY
MAL HOWLS in pain. He's alone in the infirmary, sitting on the edge of the examination table, wrapping a bandage around his midsection. It's already stained with blood. He breathes hard, then tries to rise. He nearly passes out from that.
He manages to steady himself, moves to the counter, rummages around in some of Simon's supplies -- comes up with another needle like we saw Simon shoot up Zoe with. He injects himself, reacts violently.

CLOSE - MAL
His eyes wide, wide awake. He falls back, hands shaking. PUSH IN on his hand as he drops the needle.
KAYLEE: (O.S.) Cap?

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY
An uninjured Mal turns away from the table where Zoe lies. Now the medical monitor beeps a constant, steady rhythm. Mal moves to Kaylee at the infirmary door. She looks pale, worried. They step into --

INT. SERENITY - COMMON AREA
KAYLEE: Zoe gonna be okay?
MAL: You let the doctor worry about Zoe. Come on. Tell me what you know.
KAYLEE: Catalyzer on the port compression coil blew. That's where the trouble started.
MAL: I need that in Captain Dummy-Talk, Kaylee.
KAYLEE: We're dead in the water.
MAL: Can you fix it?
KAYLEE: I could try.
MAL: Just get us to limpin'. That's all I need.
She looks at him. Nearly staring.
MAL: What? What is it?
KAYLEE: Well, it's worse than just the coil.
MAL: How can it be worse?
KAYLEE: Main life-support's down on account of the engine being dead.
MAL: Right. But we got auxiliary life support --
KAYLEE: No. We don't. It ain't even on. Explosion musta knocked it out.
MAL: So what are we breathin'?
KAYLEE: Whatever got pumped into the atmo before the explosion shut it all down.
Jayne has overheard part of this, joins them.
JAYNE: Most of that oxygen got ate up by the fire on its way out the door.
KAYLEE: Well, whatever's left is what we got.
Mal takes a beat.
MAL: How long?
KAYLEE: A couple of hours, maybe. We'll start to feel it, and then we won't feel nothing at all.
BLACK OUT.


EXT. SPACE
Serenity, not moving.

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY
Simon checks the still unconscious Zoe's vitals. Inara appears at the infirmary door.
INARA: How is she?
SIMON: She's till unconscious. But her vitals are strong. She won't know it, but as long as her condition remains like this, she'll outlive us all.
SIMON: (then) She's using less oxygen.
He moves into the common area. Sits. She joins him.
SIMON: I always thought the name Serenity had a vaguely funereal sound to it.
INARA: I love this ship. I have from the first moment I saw it.
SIMON: I just don't want to die on it.
INARA: I don't want to die at all.
SIMON: Suffocation's not exactly the most dignified way to go. The human body will involuntarily --
INARA: Please, I don't really require a clinical description right now.
SIMON: I'm sorry. I just, uh...
SIMON: (beat) It was my birthday.
He smiles wistfully. She smiles back. Puts her hand over his.

INT. SERENITY - BOOK'S ROOM
Book sighs, sitting at his little table reading the Bible.
RIVER: (O.S.) Don't be afraid.
He looks up, a bit startled.
RIVER: (re: his Bible) That's what it says. Don't be afraid.
BOOK: Yes.
RIVER: But you are afraid.
BOOK: Yes.
RIVER: You're afraid we're going to run out of air.That we'll die gasping. 
RIVER: (then) But we won't. That's not going to happen.
He looks at her, taken by her utter certainty.
RIVER: (flatly) We'll freeze to death first.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Wash sits in his chair, upset.
MAL: You get that beacon sent?
WASH: Yeah, it's sent.
MAL: Good.
WASH: Pointless.
MAL: What was that?
WASH: Nothing, sir. It's a brilliant plan, I'm sure we'll all be saved.
MAL: I'm getting a little weary of this attitude, Wash.
WASH: Are you? Well, I'm so very sorry, sir. I guess the news that we're all gonna be purple and bloated and fetal in a few hours has made me little snippy.
MAL: It's possible someone might pick up that signal.
WASH: (pissed) No, Mal. It's not possible. No one's gonna pick up the damn signal. You wanted us flying under the radar, remember? Well, that's where we are: out of range of anyone or anything.
MAL: Then make it go further.
WASH: I -- What?
MAL: Make the signal go further.
WASH: Can't make it go further.
MAL: Not if all you're gonna do is sit here and whinge about it, no.
WASH: What do you expect me to do, Mal?
MAL: Whatever you have to. And if you can't do it from here, then get a suit on and get out on the side of the boat and --
WASH: (voice rising) And what? Wave my arms around?
MAL: Wave your arms around, jump up and down. Divert the nav sats to the transmitter. Whatever.
WASH: Divert the...? Right. Because teenage pranks are fun when you're about to die.
MAL: Give the beacon a boost, wouldn't it?
WASH: Yes, Mal. It would boost the signal, but even if some passerby did happen to receive, all it'd do is muck up their navigation.
MAL: Could be that's true.
WASH: Damn right, it's true! They'd be forced to stop and dig out our signal before they could even go anyplace!
A beat as Wash lets what he just said sink in. He snaps:
WASH: Well, maybe I should do that, then!
MAL: (snapping back) Maybe you should!
WASH: Okay!
MAL: Good!
WASH: Fine!
JAYNE: Hey!
Jayne has appeared in the doorway.
JAYNE: What do you two think you're doing? Fightin' at a time like this. They both ease off. Cool down.
JAYNE: (as he turns and goes) You'll use up all the air!
A KLAXON SOUNDS

INT. SERENITY - AFTDECK CORRIDOR
ENGINE PART slams down into FRAME. PULL BACK to REVEAL:
INJURED MAL - struggling around the corner.
Mal stumbling down the corridor toward the engine room. The ship warns over the klaxon:
SERENITY: (V.O.) Life support failure. Check oxygen levels at once.
Then the same ALERT repeats IN CHINESE.
SERENITY: (cont'd; V.O.) [Jeo-shung yong-jur goo-jang. Jien-cha yong-chi gong yin. - "Life support failure. Check oxygen levels at once."]

MAL APPEARS in the engine room doorway. He's uninjured.
MAL: Bester!

INT. SERENITY - ENGINE ROOM - FLASHBACK
MAL: What's this I hear 'bout yet another delay?
As Mal moves closer to the engine room, we can make out BESTER'S ARMY BOOTS sticking out from under the engine. The faint sound of erotic moaning.
MAL: You were supposed to have that engine fixed and us up and --
Bester's shorts are down around his army boots. He's having energetic sex with an unseen FEMALE. Mal averts his eyes. The erotic moaning? A lot louder now.
MAL: What in the name of [suo-yo duh doh shr-dang - "all that's proper...?"]
MAL: (long beat) Bester.
Still with the energetic sex.
MAL: Bester.
More with the energetic sex.
MAL: Bester!
Clanging and scuffling noises. Bester climbs out, bare chest showing off intricate tattoos, yanking up his shorts.
BESTER: What?
Bester just looks at Mal innocently.
MAL: You do realize we been parked on this rock a week longer than we planned?
BESTER: Yeah, but... uh, there's stuff to do.
MAL: As for example that job we got waitin' for us on Paquin. When we landed here you said you needed a few days to get space worthy again and is there somethin' wrong with your bunk?
BESTER: What?
More impatient staring, then Bester gets it and laughs.
BESTER: Oh! No, Captain.
BESTER: (leans forward) She like engines. They make her hot.
MAL: Bester. Get your prairie harpy off my boat, and put us back in the air.
BESTER: Okay. But... can't.
MAL: Whaddya mean "can't."
BESTER: No can do, Cap. Secondary grav boot's shot.
KAYLEE: (O.S.) No it ain't.
Kaylee pops up, getting dressed. The men look at her.
KAYLEE: Ain't nothing wrong with your grav boot. Grav boot's just fine.
KAYLEE: (to Mal) Hello.
She drops down again, out of view. Mal glances at Bester. Bester's a bit flustered.
BESTER: (to Mal) She doesn't... that's not what...
BESTER: (to Kaylee) No it ain't!
KAYLEE: (reappearing) Sure it is. Grav boot ain't your trouble. I seen the trouble plain as day when I was down there on my back before. Your reg couple's bad.
BESTER: (clueless) The... red... what?
KAYLEE: Reg couple. Right here. See?
BESTER: (beat) No.
KAYLEE: This. 
KAYLEE: (then) I'm pointin' right at it.
She rolls her eyes, sighs, reaches in, breaks off a part of the engine.
BESTER: Hey!
KAYLEE: Here.
She plunks the part in Bester's hand. She reaches back in, tinkers.
KAYLEE: (re: a nearby wrench) Hand me that, will ya? Don't really serve much of a purpose, anyway. Just tends to gum up the works when it gets tacked. So I figure, why even have one? Better to just take your g-line, plug it straight into the port-pin-lock, and that should, uh...
She's done. The turbine starts to turn.
KAYLEE: There.
BESTER: What'd you do?
MAL: She fixed it.
KAYLEE: Well, it wasn't really broke.
Bester looks at the part in his hand.
MAL: Where'd you learn to do that, miss?
KAYLEE: (shrugs) Just do it, that's all. My daddy says I got natural talent.
MAL: I'll say you do at that.
BESTER: (re: the part) Don't we need this?
MAL: You work for your daddy, do you?
KAYLEE: Well, when he got work, which ain't been too often lately.
MAL: You got much experience with a vessel like this?
KAYLEE: I ain't never even been up in one before.
MAL: Wanna?
KAYLEE: You mean...?
MAL: Sure.
KAYLEE: For how long?
MAL: Long as you like. Long as you can keep her in the sky.
KAYLEE: You offering me a job?
BESTER: What?
MAL: Believe I just did.
KAYLEE: (big smile) I just gotta ask my folks!
She pulls her hastily assembled wardrobe about her, pushes past Mal and a stunned Bester.
KAYLEE: Don't leave without me!
Mal watches Kaylee go, amused. Bester just blinks.
BESTER: Mal. Whaddya need two mechanics for?
MAL: I really don't.

INT. SERENITY - ENGINE ROOM
MAL: Kaylee!
Mal has entered the engine room. He looks off screen seeing --
-- KAYLEE is just sitting there, forlorn. She's holding the same piece of equipment that Mal was dragging in here. But the one she's got is twisted and melted. She stares at it.
MAL: Kaylee, what are you doing?
KAYLEE: Sorry, Captain. I'm real sorry. I shoulda kept better care of her. Usually she lets me know when something's wrong. Maybe she did, I just wasn't paying attention...
MAL: (patiently) I cannot be having this from you right now. We got work to do. [Dong-ma? - "Understand?"]
KAYLEE: (re: the engine part) Catalyzer's broke. Gonna need a new one.
MAL: There is no new one. You gotta make do with what you got.
KAYLEE: It's broke.
She just sits there. He gently makes her stand up.
MAL: Come on. This the part?
MAL: (she nods) It don't hardly seem like nothing. All right. Where's it go?
She shows him the spot in the engine.
KAYLEE: Here. But it don't fit no more. He tries to install it, but no go.
MAL: Well you gotta figure a way to make it fit.
KAYLEE: Sometimes a thing gets broke, can't be fixed.
MAL: Without this, engine don't turn?
MAL: (she shakes her head "no") Engine don't turn, life support won't function. We don't breathe. You want to keep breathin', don't you?
MAL: (she nods) So do I.
A KLAXON SOUNDS

INT. SERENITY - ENGINE ROOM
Where the ALARM originated. Mal, gut-shot, listens to the ship warning him.
SERENITY: (V.O.) Life support failure. Check oxygen levels at once.
Then the same ALERT repeats IN CHINESE.
SERENITY: (cont'd; V.O.) [Jeo-shung yong-jur goo-jang. Jien-cha yong-chi gong yin. - "Life support failure. Check oxygen levels at once."]
Mal's fumbling with the ship part, trying to install the catalyzer into the failed compression coil.
He wipes sweat from his brow with the back of his hand -- leaving a smear of blood above his left eye. He blinks it back.
The KLAXON continues to sound. The ship's message repeats in English again.
Mal nearly has the part installed, but it slips from his bloody fingers and drops into the engine.
He can't believe that just happened. And as the alert continues to sound --
BLACK OUT.


INT. SERENITY - COMMON AREA
Everyone sits huddled together. They're wearing coats and blankets. It's cold. Mal stands before the assembled, grim.
MAL: As you're all keenly aware, we've run into a bit of a situation. Engine's down, life support's on the fritz, and I got nine people here all wanting to breathe. Truth is, ain't got a whole lot of options at this juncture.
A beat. They all look back at him.
MAL: (cont'd) So... instead of focusing on what we don't got -- time to talk about what it is we do. And what we got are two shuttles. Short range. Won't go far. But each got heat, and they each got air. Last longer than what's left in Serenity.
SIMON: Long enough to reach someplace?
MAL: No.
BOOK: So... where will we go, then?
MAL: Far as you can get. We send both shuttles off in opposite directions -- betters the chances of someone being seen, maybe getting picked up.
MAL: (then) Shepherd Book, Kaylee, Jayne will ride with Inara in her shuttle. Doc, you and your sis will go with Wash and Zoe -- seein' as how Zoe still needs some doctorin'.
KAYLEE: What about you?
MAL: Four people per shuttle. That's the arrangement. Evens the odds. 
MAL: (then) I'm staying with Serenity.
KAYLEE: Captain.
MAL: We sent out a beacon. Even managed to boost it a little. By some chance, we get a response, someone's gonna have to be here to answer.
Nobody believes that's going to happen.
MAL: Let's get those shuttles prepped.
Wash stands, starts moving to the stairs near the infirmary.
MAL: Wash -- shuttles are that way.
WASH: I know. But like you said -- someone might answer the beacon. And when they do, I want to make sure that you can call everyone back. Won't take but a minute.
Mal nods. Wash moves off.
MAL: Jayne, you get shuttle number two ready. I'll see to Inara's. 
MAL: (to everyone else) Let's get moving. 
MAL: (as he goes) Take only what you need.
Mal moves off. Everyone's a bit stunned. Inara moves to follow Mal.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY/CATWALKS
Mal heads up the catwalks, moving toward Inara's shuttle. She appears, following.
INARA: Mal...
MAL: You fly smart, don't push too hard, shuttle life support should last you a good long while.
INARA: Mal, this isn't the ancient sea. You don't have to go down with your ship.
MAL: She ain't going down. She ain't going anywhere.
MAL: (then) Jayne'll be worth something if you run into trouble. But don't trust him, and don't let him take over. You're paid up through the end of the month. It's still your ship.
INARA: Mal...
MAL: As far as your security deposit goes... that I might have to owe you.
He enters her shuttle. She follows.

INT. INARA'S SHUTTLE - FLASHBACK
Inara steps through first. She's wearing different clothing. Mal steps in behind her. The shuttle is empty. Mal's showing her the "property."
MAL: Well, here she is.
She steps in, takes in the space for the first time.
MAL: Nice, ain't she?
INARA: Smallish.
MAL: Not overly. How much room do you really need for what you do, anyway?
She ignores that. She moves into the cockpit. Blue sky outside the windows. Mal follows.
MAL: I got a surveyor and his wife interested in renting it. They're just waiting to hear back.
INARA: What's her range?
MAL: Standard short. She'll break atmo from a wide orbit. Get you where you need to go, bring you back home again.
MAL: (beat) She's space worthy. Like the rest of Serenity is.
INARA: No need to sound so defensive, Captain.
INARA: (moving past him) I prefer something with a few miles on it.
He watches her as she moves into the main chamber, looking it over.
INARA: Were we to enter into this arrangement, Captain Reynolds, there are a few things I would require from you. The foremost being complete autonomy. This shuttle would be my home. No crew member, including yourself, would be allowed entrance without my express invitation.
MAL: You'd get your privacy.
INARA: And just so we're clear, under no circumstances will I be servicing you or anyone who is under your employ.
MAL: I'll post a sign.
INARA: That won't be necessary. The other thing I would insist upon is some measure of assurance that when I make an appointment with a client, I'm in a position to keep that appointment. So far as such assurances are possible on a vessel of this type.
MAL: That's an awful lot of caveats and addendums there, miss.
INARA: As I stated, I just want to be clear.
MAL: Well. I'll be sure and take all of that into consideration when I review the applications.
INARA: Don't be ridiculous. You're going to rent this shuttle to me.
MAL: Am I?
INARA: Yes. And for one quarter less than your asking price.
MAL: That a fact?
INARA: It is.
MAL: And you figure you'll be getting this discount... why exactly?
INARA: You want me. You want me on your ship.
MAL: Do I?
INARA: Yes. Because I can bring something that your surveyor or any of the other fish you might have on line can't -- a certain respectability.
MAL: Respecta --
INARA: And based on what little I've seen of your operation, I suspect that's something you could use.
MAL: Fine. Let me ask you this: if you're so respectable, why are you even here? I mean, I heard tell of fancy ladies such as yourself shipping out with the big luxury liners and the like. But a registered Companion on a boat like this? What are you running from?
INARA: I'm not running from anything.
He doesn't believe her.
MAL: If it's Alliance trouble you got, you might want to consider another ship. Some on board here fought for the Independents.
INARA: The Alliance has no quarrel with me. I supported Unification.
MAL: Did ya? Well, I don't suppose you're the only whore that did.
She looks at him. Smiles.
INARA: Oh -- one further addendum. That's the last time you get to call me "whore."
She walks past him.
MAL: Absolutely. Never again.

INT. INARA'S SHUTTLE
Mal moves about the cockpit.
MAL: Keep everything set as low as possible. Don't waste what you got. She pushes him out of the way.
INARA: Let me do that. You never could operate this thing. He lets her take over. They look at each other. Long beat.
MAL: And try not to talk. Talking uses up air. Ain't no need for it.
MAL: (moves toward door) 
INARA: Mal... come with us.
MAL: Can't. Four to a shuttle, Inara. Four.
INARA: One more. You know it can't make a difference. Not now.
MAL: I'm not leaving Serenity.
INARA: Mal -- you don't have to die alone.
MAL: Everybody dies alone.HOLD on their look for a moment.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Wash appears in the doorway.
WASH: Everything's set and ready.
REVEAL - MAL moving toward the bridge.
MAL: Good.
WASH: I linked the nav systems of both shuttles into the helm, here.
Wash points out a LARGE, RED BUTTON on the navigation control panels.
WASH: When your miracle gets here, you just pound this button once. It'll call back both shuttles.
Mal nods. Wash wants to say something. He's about to speak, but before he can.
MAL: Go see to your wife.
Wash takes a beat. Then exits.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
Mal walks with Jayne. Jayne has a duffle and some guns slung over his shoulder.
JAYNE: I went ahead and closed off all below deck vents. Diverted what's left to the bridge. Ain't much. So my advice is, seal off everything tight behind you on your way back up. Might buy you some time.
Mal nods. He's looking up at the upper catwalks
JAYNE: And I prepped a suit for you. It's hanging in the foredeck. So when the time comes, you can --
MAL: (cuts him off) I won't be needing it, but thanks.
JAYNE: Okay. Well.
Jayne takes a beat. Then he moves off, heading up the catwalk stairs.
To the left, Wash and Simon carry a stretcher with unconscious Zoe into the second shuttle. River follows.
Mal looks to his right. Book and Kaylee enter Inara's shuttle. Inara stands at the doorway, looking down at him.
WASH - At the door to shuttle two. He slides the door shut.
JAYNE - Reaches the top of the catwalk. Motions for Inara to go inside. A beat. He eyes on Mal. Then she disappears inside. Jayne follows, shuts the door. Mal stands alone in the big, empty cargo bay, then exits as:

EXT. SPACE
The two shuttles detach from Serenity and go their separate ways off into space.

INT. SERENITY - UPPER DECK
Mal closes off the door to the aftdeck. Moves through the kitchen area and into the foredeck, slides that door shut behind him, too.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Mal closes off the bridge, takes out a blanket and wraps it around him, then sits in the pilot's chair.
He's cold and drowsy from lack of oxygen.

EXT. SPACE
Serenity. Silent. Alone. Dark. Unmoving.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - LATER
Some time has passed. Mal is looking half frozen and unconscious in the pilot's chair. He doesn't react to the SOUND of a SIGNAL as it starts come through on the console.

CLOSE - MONITOR
THE SIGNAL on the console. A FUZZY IMAGE. A MAN'S FACE through the STATIC.
CAPTAIN: (V.O.) (breaking up) Firefly Serenity... This is the private salvage S.S. Walden. Receiving your distress beacon, do you read?
The message continues to repeat and CRACKLE.
Mal sits motionless. Not hearing it.
More STATICKY SIGNAL. More CRACKLING. But now Mal starts stir slightly. A few more WORDS of the DISTRESS REPLY crackle through...
Mal forces his heavy-lidded eyes open just as... The transmission ends. No more signal.
Mal tries to orient himself. His head lolls as he looks to the now silent monitors. His bleary eyes shift up to the window --

ANOTHER SHIP
Twice the size of Serenity --rises up there, right in front of the windshield.

EXT. SPACE
The S.S. Walden nose-to-nose with the smaller Serenity.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Mal on the bridge, more alert. WE SEE the IMAGE of the CAPTAIN of the Walden on the vid monitor.
CAPTAIN: I'm sorry for your troubles, Captain. They sound many. But you do understand that I can't invite you aboard my vessel. I don't know you.
MAL: I ain't asking for a ride, Captain. Just a little push is all.
CAPTAIN: Right. Your mechanical trouble. Your compression coil, you say?
MAL: It was the catalyzer.
CAPTAIN: Not even the coil? Catalyzer's a nothing part, Captain.
MAL: It's nothing till you don't got one. Then it appears to be everything.
CAPTAIN: Well, it is possible we might have something that could do you. We just come from a big salvage job off Ita Moon.
MAL: I'd appreciate it.
CAPTAIN: Trouble is... how can I know for certain your story's true? Ambush could be waiting for me and my people on the other side.
MAL: You can plainly see my shuttles've been launched, just like I said. And by now you've scanned me. You know I got no life support.
CAPTAIN: I don't expect to see any weapons when we board.
MAL: And I do expect to see that engine part before I open the door.
CAPTAIN: (smiles) I feel like maybe we can do business.
The Captain's face disappears from the monitor.

EXT. SPACE
As the S.S. Walden's airlock attaches to that of Serenity.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
Mal, breathing very shallow, waits near the standing airlock door controls.
The Captain appears at the airlock doors. He holds up the catalyzer at the window. Mal activates the airlocks doors.
As the doors open, there is a tremendous RUSH OF AIR from other side. Mal savors it, closes his eyes for a beat, just breathing it in. When he opens his eyes again --
-- The Captain and his FOUR LACKEYS have their guns raised and aimed at him. Mal's hands go up.
BLACK OUT.


INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
Right where we left off, Mal with his hands up and guns pointed at him.
CAPTAIN: Check him.
One of Captain's crew moves in, frisks Mal as --
CAPTAIN: (to another lackey) Search the ship. Start in the cockpit, work your way down.
MAL: This what you meant by ambush?
CAPTAIN: (smiles) We're just verifying your story. 
CAPTAIN: (to lackeys) You find anyone on board not supposed to be -- you shoot 'em.
As the lackeys go --
MAL: Thought we were gonna be reasonable about this?
MARCO: Reason?
Suddenly, we are

EXT. SERENITY - RAMP/CARGO BAY - DAY - FLASHBACK
On the open ramp of Serenity and this time it's Mal and Zoe with their hands up -- THREE BANDITS are holding guns on them, and MARCO is their leader.
MARCO: (to his partner) He's gonna talk to us about "reason," now.
JAYNE: Yeah. That's a joke.
REVEAL JAYNE as part of the gang holding Mal and Zoe at gunpoint.

MAL AND ZOE -- a brief, sotto voce exchange:
MAL: Which one you figure tracked us?
ZOE: The ugly one, sir.
MAL: (beat) Could you be more specific?

BACK TO THE BANDITS
MARCO: Do we look reasonable to you?
MAL: Well. Looks can be deceiving.
JAYNE: Not as deceiving as a low down dirty... deceiver.
MAL: Well said. Wasn't that well said, Zoe?
ZOE: Had a kind poetry to it, sir.
JAYNE: You want I should shoot 'em now, Marco?
MARCO: Wait until they tell us where they put the stuff.
JAYNE: That's a good idea. Good idea. Tell us where the stuff's at so I can shoot you.
MAL: Point of interest? Offering to shoot us might not work so well as an incentive as you might imagine. Anyway, we've hidden it. So, you kill us, you'll never find it.
JAYNE: Found you easy enough.
MAL: Yeah. Yeah you did, didn't you?
MAL: (then) How much they paying you?
JAYNE: Huh?
MAL: I mean, let's say you did kill us. Or didn't. There could be torture. Whatever. But somehow you found the goods. What would your cut be?
JAYNE: Seven percent, straight off the top.
MAL: Seven? Oh.
Mal looks surprised. Jayne squints.
JAYNE: What?
MAL: Hmm? Nothing. Not a thing. No, I just... 
MAL: (to Zoe) That seem low to you?
ZOE: It does, sir.
JAYNE: That ain't low...
MARCO: Stop it.
JAYNE: Seven percent's standard.
MAL: (laughs) Okay. Zoe, I'm paying you too much.
JAYNE: Why? What does she get?
MARCO: Knock it off.
MAL: Look, forget I said anything. I'm sure you're treated very well. You get the perks. Got your own room.
MAL: (off Jayne's reaction) No? You share a bunk?
JAYNE: (re: the other guy) With that one.
MAL: Really?
MARCO: Jayne, this ain't funny.
JAYNE: Yeah, I ain't laughin'.
MAL: You move on over to this side, we'll not only show you where the stuff's at -- we'll see to it you get your fair share. Not no sad "seven."
JAYNE: Private room?
MARCO: Jayne!
MAL: Your own room. Full run of the kitchen. Whole shot.
MARCO: Jayne. I ain't askin --
Jayne shoots Marco in the leg and AIMS his gun at the other bandit in his gang.
JAYNE: Shut up.
JAYNE: (to Mal) How big a room?

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
The Captain with his gun trained on Mal. The others start to return to the cargo bay.
LACKEY_#1: Ship's clear, Captain.
CAPTAIN: You check the engine room?
LACKEY_#1: (nods) It's like he said. Catalyzer's blown. That's all he needs.
MAL: You know anything that's worth anything's really right here in this cargo bay. So you take a look around, decide what you think is fair.
CAPTAIN: Already decided.
The Captain shoots Mal in the gut. Mal falls back, onto the floor.
CAPTAIN: We're taking your ship.
Mal presses his hand to his gut -- it comes away bloody. The Captain coolly instructs his crew, and tosses the catalyzer to one of his men.
CAPTAIN: Billy, get this plugged in. Jesse, call Stern over here. You and him'll pilot this pile of [go se - "crap"] out of here.

MAL'S POV
There is a gun strapped to the underbelly of a nearby workbench.
CAPTAIN: We'll get it as far as --
He stops short as he hears the sound of a GUN being COCKED --

CAPTAIN'S POV
Looking down the barrel of Mal's gun.
MAL: (eyes on Captain) Jesse, don't call Stern. Billy, leave the catalyzer.
CAPTAIN: (nods) Do as he says.
The lackey with the catalyzer sets it on the cargo bay floor.
MAL: (to Captain) Take your people and go.
CAPTAIN: You would have done the same.
MAL: We can already see I haven't. 
MAL: (then) Now get the hell off my ship.
And now the Captain and all his men back away to the air lock doors. Mal, through sheer force of will, keeps the gun on them, moves to the air lock door controls. Closes hits the button as they step through. The doors shut.
And Mal collapses on the cargo bay floor. Exactly where we first found him.

EXT. SPACE
As the larger salvage ship detaches from Serenity and heads off.

INT. SERENITY - VARIOUS
The SOUND of the KLAXON repeating the life support warning, as we cut to various scenes.
SERENITY: (cont'd; V.O.) [Jeo-shung yong-jur goo-jang. Jien-cha yong-chi gong yin. - "Life support failure. Check oxygen levels at once."]
SERENITY: (V.O.) Life support failure. Check oxygen levels at once.
The cargo bay floor, blood smeared there.
The infirmary, and the trail of blood left behind by the wounded Mal.


INT. SERENITY - ENGINE ROOM
SERENITY: (V.O.) Life support failure. Check oxygen levels at once.
Gut-shot Mal fishes out the part to the compression coil. Works to fit it into the damaged engine. It takes some arduous work -- his hands are shaking -- but he does it.
SERENITY: (cont'd; V.O.) [Jeo-shung yong-jur goo-jang. Jien-cha yong-chi gong yin. - "Life support failure. Check oxygen levels at once."]
SERENITY: (V.O.) Life support failure. Check oxygen levels at once.
He fires it all up - the turbines start to spin. It works. The ALERT stops. Power is restored. Life support functioning again.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
CLOSE SHOT of the BIG RED button Wash installed to contact the shuttles.

INT. SERENITY - CORRIDOR
MAL'S POV - Mal is dragging himself to the bridge, flashes of his bloody hands in frame.

INT. SERENITY - KITCHEN AREA
MAL'S POV - He stumbles drunkenly through the kitchen toward the foredeck doorway.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Mal stumbles through the doorway of the bridge, breathing heavily.
He tries to reach the button, but only makes it halfway before his body gives out. He passes out on the bridge floor.
BLACKOUT.
VOICES. Familiar voices. Growing more present as Mal wakes up in --

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY
Mal blinks as he sees --
-- Simon, Book, Inara, Jayne, then River, then Wash, and finally Zoe, who's laying on a bunk nearby. No on is directly facing him. Various backs to him. They're in conversation, though since we're in Mal's POV we can't quite make out what they're saying.
(PUSH IN on Mal's disoriented face.)
INARA: I feel like maybe we should do something about all the blood. I don't think it's something he should see when he wakes up.
JAYNE: He seen blood before. Lots of it.
INARA: Yes, I'm certain that's true, but sometimes it seems different when it's one's own blood.
JAYNE: Well I didn't shoot him, so don't look at me for the scrubbin' of it.
INARA: No one's asking you to scrub anything. Although a bath wouldn't kill you.
ZOE: (to Wash) I guess it's a fair bet to say I missed birthday cake.
WASH: It's okay, honey. Nobody got to have any. It's still on the floor and some of the walls upstairs, though. If you want I'll run up there and scrape up a piece.
ZOE: You'd do that for me?
WASH: I'd do anything for you. You know that.
(PULL BACK off Mal's face to reveal that Zoe's the first to notice that Mal's come into consciousness. She smiles at him.)
ZOE: Welcome back, sir.
The others follow her look, see he's waking up.
MAL: (disoriented) I go someplace?
BOOK: Very nearly.
INARA: We thought we lost you.
MAL: Well, I've been right here.
Mal notes Wash hooked up to an IV -- he's giving Mal a transfusion. Mal doesn't quite understand that.
MAL: Wash, you okay?
WASH: (amused) Yeah, Mal. I'm fine.
MAL: You got a thing in your arm.
WASH: Yeah.
SIMON: (to Mal) Try not to speak. You're heavily medicated and you've lost a lot of blood.
MAL: Oh.
MAL: (then, realizing) Thought I ordered you all off the ship?
The others exchange looks.
MAL: (to Wash, trying to remember) I call you back?
WASH: No, Mal. You didn't.
ZOE: I take full responsibility, cap.
SIMON: The decision saved your life.
ZOE: Won't happen again, sir.
MAL: (to Zoe) Good. And thanks. I'm grateful.
ZOE: It was my pleasure, sir.
They hold the look between them. Jayne observes that exchange.
JAYNE: Well, hey, you know. We'da been back first, except there's something wrong with Inara's shuttle. She done somethin' to it, Mal. Smells funny.
INARA: I told you, that's incense.
JAYNE: So you say.
Kaylee enters. Sees that Mal's awake.
KAYLEE: (brightly) Hey, Captain.
MAL: Hey.
KAYLEE: You fixed the ship. Good work.
MAL: Thanks.
SIMON: All right. I have to insist. The captain needs to rest.
MAL: (nodding off) Yeah. Think the doc might not be wrong about that one. Just gonna need a few... (forces himself not to drift) You all gonna be here when I wake up?
BOOK: We'll be here.
Mal allows himself to close his eyes.
MAL: 'kay. (eyes closed, smiles) That's good...
(As we PUSH IN closer to his face, we start to HEAR VOICES:)
SALESMAN: (V.O.) Yep. A real beauty, ain't she? Yes, sir. A right smart purchase, this vessel.

EXT. USED SPACE SHIP LOT - DAY
SALESMAN: I tell you what, you buy this ship, treat her proper, she'll be with ya for the rest of your life.
Now WE SEE that they're standing in front of a totally different ship. Big and yellow, and not Serenity.
SALESMAN: Son? Hey, son?
The Salesman notices that Mal doesn't seem to be paying attention.
SALESMAN: You hear a word I been saying?
He hasn't. Because he's looking across the lot at something else.
Across the lot sits Serenity, dirty, broken-down, and entrancing.


EXT. SPACE
Serenity in flight, music.

INT. SERENITY - KITCHEN AREA - CONTINUOUS
JAYNE cleans a gun, INARA sits on a couch next to KAYLEE they are playing a game (Mah Jong?), SIMON dishes much into a bowl for RIVER who stands next to him
RIVER: I don't want any.
SIMON: River, you have to eat. It's good. It tastes like... (uses chopsticks to eat some) ... It's good.
JAYNE: Smells like crotch.
KAYLEE: Jayne!
JAYNE: Well, it does.
WASH and ZOE enter through the corridor, conversation in progress
WASH: We don't even have to go someplace fancy. We can just go to the park or something. Feed the pigeons.
ZOE: Sure. (puts arms around WASH) Feed the pigeons. Probably get the firing squad for littering. 
(walks into room)
WASH: Come on, it's not that bad.
ZOE: It is. It's a Core planet, it's spotless. It's got sensors, and where there ain't sensors, there's feds. All Central planets are the same.
WASH: Could you please tell my wife the fun she's missing out on?
INARA: (laughs) Ariel's quite a nice place, actually. There are some beautiful museums, not to mention some of the finest restaurants in the Core.
WASH: But ... not boring, like she made it sound. There's a .. .. Um, ah, um. (looks to SIMON for help)
SIMON: There's hiking.
WASH: Yeah!
SIMON: And you can go swimming in a bioluminescent lake.
WASH nods encouragingly.
ZOE: I don't care if it's got sunsets twenty-four hours a day. I ain't setting foot on that planet.
MAL: (walking into room) No one is setting foot on that fancy rock. I don't want anyone leaving the ship. Come to think of it, I don't want anyone looking out the windows or talking loud. We're here to drop off Inara, that's it. 
(dishes mush into bowl)
JAYNE: (assembling his gun) What's the point of coming to the Core if I can't even step off the boat?
MAL: You could have got off with Shepherd Book at the Bathgate Abbey. Could have been meditating on the wonders of your rock garden by now.
JAYNE: Well it beats just sitting.
WASH: It is just sitting.
We don't see KAYLEE and INARA; RIVER is looking at JAYNE as he licks his knife.
KAYLEE: (V.O) (to INARA) So, how long you gonna be planetside?
INARA: Shouldn't be more than a day or two.
WASH: Big stop just to renew your license to companion. Can I use companion as a verb?
INARA: (laughs, plays game) It's Guild law. All Companions are required to undergo a physical examination once a year.
JAYNE hocks and spits on his gun.
SIMON: (pauses eating in disgust) Could you not do that while we're... ever?
JAYNE spits on his gun, looking straight at SIMON. SIMON stares at JAYNE, appalled, then looks away and starts to get up from the table.
WASH: (to INARA) So, two days in a hospital? That's awful. Don't you just hate doctors?
SIMON: (standing right here) Hey.
RIVER walks to the cutlery bin.
WASH: I mean, present company excluded.
RIVER takes out a BIG knife, no one notices. SIMON sits.
JAYNE: Let's not be excluding people. (smirks at SIMON) That'd be rude.
RIVER walks up to JAYNE, we can see a flash of reflected light on his smiling face just before RIVER slashes him across the arm with the BIG knife.
JAYNE: (in pain) Sonofa GAH!!
WASH: What the hell?!
KAYLEE and INARA jump up from the game table. JAYNE's face contorts with anger and he backhands RIVER across the face. RIVER falls to the deck, the knife is knocked out of her hand. JAYNE looks down at the bloody gash across his shirt. SIMON runs to RIVER.
SIMON: River! NO!
KAYLEE: Oh my god!
INARA: He's bleeding.
ZOE: That's deep.
KAYLEE: Are you okay?
SIMON helps RIVER sit up, she's bleeding from the mouth. INARA, KAYLEE and MAL crowd around JAYNE who is examining his wound.
SIMON: River?
JAYNE: (in shock and pain) Oh, uh.
RIVER: He looks better in red.
Everyone stands around in confusion and shock. MAL looks between RIVER, who seems surprised by the fuss, and JAYNE, who is seething with anger.

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY - CONTINUOUS
JAYNE reclines on a gurney, bare-chested, while SIMON stitches his wound. MAL stands back.
JAYNE: (gasping in pain) Gorram freak's completely off her axel.
SIMON: I'm sorry about this. I don't know what--
JAYNE: (to SIMON) Shut up, I ain't talking to you. 
JAYNE: (to MAL) She's gotta go. Both of them's gotta go. Ariel's as good a place as any to leave 'em. Might even pick us up a reward for our trouble.
MAL: No one's getting left.
JAYNE: She belongs in a bughouse. You don't pitch her off this boat right now, I swear to you...
MAL: What? What are you swearing, Jayne?
JAYNE: They don't get gone, you better start locking up your room at night. Next time little sister gets in a murdering mood, might be you she comes calling on. Maybe Kaylee. Or Inara. You let them stay, we're gonna find out.
MAL: (leans in very close to JAYNE) Finish your work, doctor. (SIMON turns away) This is my boat. They're part of my crew. No one's letting left. Best you get used to that.
JAYNE looks at MAL, swallows visibly, looks very unhappy as he gets up from gurney, pushes bloody shirt at SIMON, who clutches it to his chest.
JAYNE: (to Simon) You owe me a shirt. (Leaves room)
MAL: (walks over to SIMON) She's to stay confined to her room, at all times, no exceptions. (SIMON nods, unhappily) Take her to the kitchen, the infirmary, whatever, you ask me first, understand?
SIMON: I do.
MAL: When I took you and your sister in, the deal was you keep her in check. You can't hold up your end, we're going to have to revisit the deal.
SIMON nods, looks down. MAL looks away.
MAL: She's getting worse, isn't she?
SIMON: Yes.

EXT. ARIEL - DAY
Serenity is landing in a futuristic city, full of gleaming spires and flying cars.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
KAYLEE and INARA walk across a catwalk. JAYNE and MAL are below.
KAYLEE: Just look at the bright side. Maybe you'll meet a young, handsome doctor and he'll ask you out and... (beat) What's the Companion policy on dating?
INARA: (laughing) It's ...complicated.
KAYLEE: Mmmm. Well, that figures.
INARA: Stay out of trouble.
INARA and KAYLEE hug and kiss cheeks.
KAYLEE: You, too. Bye.
INARA walks through a corridor. KAYLEE walks down the stairs.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - LATER
Cargo bay floor. JAYNE and MAL play horseshoes. MAL is playing blue, JAYNE, red.
JAYNE: Ah! (he's thrown a ringer) How're we going to find a job if we don't leave the ship?
MAL: (lines up throw) It's Alliance territory. Ain't any jobs worth having.
WASH sits on some barrels, ZOE standing beside him
WASH: Nor the last three places we've been.
JAYNE: (makes a throw, missing) My pop always said, 'anyone who can't find work ain't looking hard enough'. (walks over to gather up horseshoes) We ain't even looking at all.
KAYLEE walks down to the Cargo bay floor. SIMON enters.
SIMON: You can stop looking. There is a client. (beat) Me.
ZOE and WASH, JAYNE and MAL look at him as music twangs.
SIMON: I have a job for you.


INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
Right where we left off. Crew minus Inara and Book are all staring at Simon.
MAL: You've got a job for us?
SIMON: One that will pay for itself ten times over.
Everyone circles close to SIMON.
JAYNE: Aw, forget it. We ain't that desperate.
SIMON: (holds out a vial) You know what this is? It's a common immune booster called isoprovaline. Street value for a dosage this size, fifty platinum.
JAYNE looks intrigued; KAYLEE and MAL exchange looks.
SIMON: Maybe twenty credits.
ZOE takes the first vial; SIMON holds up another vial.
SIMON: Propoxine, maybe eighty.
JAYNE takes the vial; SIMON gives another to WASH.
SIMON: Hydrozepam, two hundred. And all of these are just from the medkit I had with me when I came on board. At a hospital like the one in Ariel City, they'll have shelves of that stuff. Whatever the take, it's more than enough payment for what I have in mind.
WASH: So, the medvault isn't the job?
SIMON: That's the payment. I tell you how to get in, get out, and what's worth taking; if you help me get River into the hospital's diagnostic ward.
MAL: What's in the diagnostic ward?
SIMON: A 3-D neuroimager. If I can get River in there, I might be able to figure out what they did to her at the Academy.
MAL: So we get you and your sister into the whatchathing and you tell us how to clean out the hospital.
SIMON: Yes.
KAYLEE: Not to be negative, but, don't the hospital need that medicine?
ZOE: Government run facility. They'd be restocked in a matter of hours.
SIMON: She's right. They'll never miss it.
MAL: Plus, folks on the rim sure could use it.
WASH: You know, it's all very sweet; stealing from the rich, selling to the poor, but you're talking about breaking into a highly secure Alliance facility. How do you on plan getting around security?
SIMON: It's not easy; but it can be done. (SIMON reaches over and takes the vials from the others). You see, like all Core hospitals, St. Lucy's has its own dedicated security force.

INT. SERENITY - KITCHEN AREA - CONTINUOUS
The others stand and sit around a table looking at schematics while SIMON walks around.
SIMON: (continuing his speech.) A small battery of local Alliance Federals substationed here. (he points at a computer screen, the others look) Now, every floor, every doorway is equipped with sensors, and at all points of entry - patient ident scans. However, once clear of those checkpoints, movement within the facility itself should be relatively unhindered. (Everyone seems rather nonplussed at SIMON the planner.) Now, the standard layout should put the medvault somewhere...
MAL: (interrupting) Now, let's go back to the ident scans. You and your sister are tagged fugitives. How do you figure we're going to get you in the building?
SIMON: Through the front door. (MAL scoffs) Believe me, Captain, getting the two of us in is going to be easy. The rest of you, that is going to be the real trick. We'll need to procure a few items off ship. I've made a list. Now, given my status as a fugitive, someone else will have to --
KAYLEE, JAYNE, and WASH all preemptively raise their hands, grinning. ZOE smiles over at MAL.
SIMON: We have some volunteers. Good. Now, before we ever make it to the front door we're going to have to breach the perimeter. Only official vehicles are allowed in, so, we'll need one.
MAL lifts an eyebrow.

EXT. ARIEL CITY - JUNKYARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS
A junkyard. KAYLEE is looking at engine parts.
SIMON: (V.O.) (continuing his speech) Now, obviously we can't steal what we need. Any illegal activity in the planning stages could end this thing before it starts. St. Lucy's Hospital contracts with the local municipal dumpyard for all its large disposals.
KAYLEE gathers up spare parts.
KAYLEE: Figures. First time on a Core and what do I get to do? Look through trash. (walks over to WASH, who is looking through trash) Couldn't he send me shopping at the Triplex, or Oooh! (picks up a piece of pipe) Synchronizers!
SIMON: (V.O.) Big hospitals mean big waste, so we shouldn't have any trouble finding what we're looking for.
WASH walks around a corner and throws a piece of junk, hitting a small ship. He gestures to KAYLEE, pleased at his discovery.

INT. SERENITY - KITCHEN AREA - CONTINUOUS
SIMON walks around while the others sit at the table.
SIMON: We'll have to look like we belong.

EXT. ARIEL CITY - DAY - CONTINUOUS
JAYNE, off ship, signing off at a Telefonix console. He waits furtively, watching the crowd pass by.
SIMON: (V.O.) All we have to do is slip a couple of bills into the right hands.
A PARTICULARLY DRESSED MAN in a beret drops two duffel bags near JAYNE. JAYNE stands and picks up the bags as he walks by. Successful trade off.
SIMON: (V.O.) That gets us uniforms, ID badges and keycards.

INT. SERENITY - JAYNE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
JAYNE dumps contents of duffel bags; uniforms, medical equipment.
SIMON: (V.O.) A little creative forgery and we've got ourselves a working alias.
JAYNE takes out a knife and starts cutting pictures of the crew.

INT. SERENITY - KITCHEN AREA - CONTINUOUS
SIMON is still talking to the group, detailing his plan.
SIMON: Now, all of these items are easy to obtain. They'll get us up to the door. Now, in order to get us in...

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY - CONTINUOUS
SIMON sits, ZOE, MAL, and JAYNE stand in front of him.
MAL: The patients were cynical and not responding and we couldn't bring them back.
SIMON: They were cyanotic.
MAL: They were cyanotic and not responding --
SIMON: (with MAL) Not responsive.
MAL: Responsive.
SIMON: (coaching) And we were unable to ...
MAL: (together) Res.. Res...
ZOE: (together) Resuscitate them.
ZOE: Yes!
JAYNE looks confused.
SIMON: Resuscitate them.
MAL: (with ZOE together) Resuscitate them.
SIMON: Good.
MAL: They were cyanotic.
SIMON: (to ZOE) What methods did you use?
ZOE: We tried pulmonary stimulators and-and cardiac... We ...
SIMON: Infusers.
ZOE: Infusers... Infusers. Pulmonary stimulators and...
All together now, ZOE, MAL, JAYNE, and SIMON,
ALL: ...and cardiac infusers.
SIMON: (to JAYNE) What about cortical electrodes?
JAYNE: Oh! Uh, we forgot 'em.
SIMON: Let's try that again.
MAL: Yeah.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
WASH is working with circuit boards. KAYLEE is welding.

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY - CONTINUOUS
Back to the practicing.
MAL: Pupils were fixed and dilapidated --
SIMON: Dilated.
MAL: Dilated! Dilated! (pounds table, swearing in Chinese) [Ching-wah tsao duh liou mahng! - "Frog-riding bastard!"]

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
KAYLEE and WASH (in tank top) work on the salvaged ship.

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY - CONTINUOUS
Throughout this scene there are several different cuts of the speech, giving the impression that this is being done many, many times. MAL stands, sits, walks around; SIMON looks on, gesticulates, coaches, looks long suffering; ZOE paces, sits; JAYNE watches, sits, stand, writes.
MAL: We got there and the patients were cyanotic... Not responding.. Non responsive... And we tried to reviv... Resuscitate them.. And, despite our best efforts.. Ah, they kicked... Despite our best efforts. Ah, they...
SIMON: (to ZOE) Which methods did you use?
ZOE: We tried pulmonary stimulators and cardiac infusers.
SIMON: (to JAYNE) What about cortical electrodes? (sees what JAYNE has been writing) What is that? (takes away what is presumably a crib sheet, balls it up)
JAYNE: (looks up) We applied, we applied the cortical electrodes. We used them electromagnetic... Reacted from... We were unable to a ... We applied the cortical electrodes but were unable to get a neural reaction from either... Unable to get a neural... (pounds table, swears in Chinese)
MAL: Response.
JAYNE: Response... Hell, I don't know. If I had wanted schooling, I'da gone to school. I'll get it.
ZOE stands in a prayerful pose.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
SIMON walks into the cargo bay, standing between KAYLEE and WASH.
SIMON: That's amazing! You two did an incredible job.
All three walk toward a fully restored ambulance ship.
KAYLEE: And now, for the finishing touch.
KAYLEE presses a button, opening the shuttle door. Out steps a uniformed ZOE, MAL, and JAYNE, all looking very medical, indeed.
SIMON: (smiling) If I didn't know better I'd say you were ready to save some lives.
MAL: Now all we need is a couple of patients.
SIMON: (losing his smile) Corpses, actually. For this to work River and I will have to be dead.
JAYNE: (smiling) Huh. I'm starting to like this plan. (chuckles)

INT. SERENITY - RIVER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
SIMON and RIVER sit on the bunk.
SIMON: We're going to be asleep. Captain Reynolds and the others will have to pretend we're dead to sneak us into the hospital. But once we're inside, we'll wake up. Everything will be fine. You understand?
RIVER: You're going to suspend cerebral, cardiac, and pulmonary activity in order to induce a proto-comatose state.
SIMON: (nodding) That's right.
RIVER: I don't wanna do it.
SIMON: I know.
RIVER: (getting upset) I don't wanna go to that place. I don't want to die.
SIMON: No, now, no one is going to die. It's okay. The others will take care of us while we're asleep, and when we get back --
River begins moaning in fright.
SIMON: (CONT'D) Shh, shh. River, it's okay. It's okay. This, this could be what we've been hoping for. When this is over, I'll be able to help you. I'll be able to make the nightmares go away. Okay?
RIVER: (nods, whispers) Okay.
SIMON: Okay. (takes a deep breath) Lie back.
RIVER reclines on the pillows. SIMON fills a syringe and prepares to inject RIVER as she looks on.
SIMON: It's time to go to sleep.
RIVER nods, crying silently.

EXT. ARIEL CITY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Establishing shot.

INT. AMBULANCE SHIP - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
The salvaged ambulance ship, the faces of the crew are light by interior panels; JAYNE's lips are moving, there are beeps and rattles and other background noise.
MAL: We speak only when spoken to, we avoid all unnecessary contact, and we stay together until we reach the morgue. Understood?
ZOE: Yes, sir.
JAYNE: (mumbling) We applied the cortical electrode...
MAL: Jayne?
JAYNE: (mumbling) ...were unable to get a neural response. (louder) Yeah, yeah, I got it.
MAL: Are we gonna have a problem?
JAYNE: I know what I gotta do.
MAL: That's not what I'm talking about. Am I gonna have a problem with you and Simon?
JAYNE: That's up to him.
MAL: Look, you got a little stabbed the other day. That's bound to make anyone a mite ornery, so I figure --
JAYNE: (interrupting) It's a good plan.
MAL: What?
JAYNE: The doc did good coming up with that job, don't mean I like him any better. Nothing buys bygones quicker than cash. Maybe I'll give him a tattoo while he's out.
MAL: Let him do his thing, and then you get him out. No messing with him for laughs.
JAYNE: Don't worry about me, as long as I get paid I'm happy. (mumbling) We applied the cortical electrodes and were unable to get a neural response. We applied the cortical electrodes...

EXT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - LANDING PAD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
The ambulance lands outside the hospital. The door opens. MAL and JAYNE, and ZOE and WASH each load a casket onto a gurney.
WASH: We've only got a few hours left before the morning shift.
MAL: Won't be an hour.
WASH returns to the ambulance; ZOE, JAYNE, and MAL wheel the gurneys past some guards, into the hospital.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT
Inside the hospital, very sterile and white; people milling about. MAL walks up to a nurses' station, where a Receiving Doctor is standing there in her scrubs.
RECEIVING_DOCTOR: What do you got?
MAL: Got a couple of DOAs, by the time we got there...
RECEIVING_DOCTOR: (interrupting, uninterested) Take them down to the morgue.
MAL looks back at ZOE, ZOE starts to push the gurney forward.
JAYNE: We applied the cortical electrodes but were unable to get a neural reaction from either patient.
The RECEIVING_DOCTOR looks at JAYNE for a second, then looks down, still uninterested. MAL grimaces at JAYNE. They head toward the morgue.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - MORGUE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
White, bright, a few bodies on gurneys, draped with blue mesh cloth.
They open the caskets, move RIVER and SIMON to gurneys. MAL injects RIVER in the left arm.
MAL: That should bring them out of it in a few minutes. Once they're up, get them to the imaging suite. (injects SIMON in the right arm) Let Simon do his thing, and haul it back to the rendezvous. Fifty minutes.
MAL and ZOE take the empty caskets out of the room.
JAYNE: Got it. I'll just sit right here.
JAYNE sits back, looking around uneasily. Sighs, stands, and leaves the room. JAYNE goes to a terminal and swipes a card, pressing the screen to reveal the Telefonix logo; he's making a call. A man in an Alliance uniform comes on screen.
AGENT_MCGINNIS: (Chinese greeting) [Ni hao. - "How are you?"]
JAYNE: I'm in.
AGENT_MCGINNIS: Do you have the fugitives?
JAYNE: You got my reward?
AGENT_MCGINNIS: Yes, just like we talked about.
JAYNE: Then I got your fugitives.
AGENT_MCGINNIS: Good. We'll see you shortly. Congratulations, you're about to become a very rich man.


INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - MORGUE - NIGHT
JAYNE walks into the morgue, looks into an empty holding drawer. Behind him, RIVER sits up.
RIVER: (smiling) Copper for a kiss.
JAYNE: (spinning, startled) Jesus! What did you say?
RIVER looks confused. SIMON starts to cough convulsively, thrashing.
JAYNE: (to SIMON) What the hell's the matter with you?
SIMON: (coughing) Nothing. Just the after effects of the drugs. I'll be fine. Just give me a second.
JAYNE: Well, your sister seems okay.
Over SIMON's coughing we can hear retching and splashing, RIVER is vomiting. Jayne shoves some white clothes at Simon.
JAYNE: You've got to get dressed. We gotta move.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
ZOE and MAL push the caskets off of an elevator, moving down the hall.
MAL: Two lefts, two rights, and we're there. You see anyone, smile.
ZOE: I don't think anyone smiles in hospitals.
MAL: Of course they do, it's the Core. Everyone's rich and happy here, why wouldn't they smile?
POMPOUS_DOCTOR: (coming up behind them) Excuse me. (they keep walking) Excuse me.
MAL: (smiling) Hi.
POMPOUS_DOCTOR: Where're you taking those bodies?
MAL: (pointing) Just downstairs to the morgue.
POMPOUS_DOCTOR: (pointing in opposite direction) Downstairs is that way.
MAL: (looking) Right. Must've gotten turned around.
DOCTOR: (snorting) Let me see your badge.
The DOCTOR looks at MAL's badge; looks at ZOE's badge.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - RECOVERY WARD - CONTINUOUS
JAYNE walks with SIMON, dressed as a doctor or orderly, as SIMON pushes RIVER, who is in a hospital gown in a wheelchair. They are passing through a recovery area, doctors, nurses, patients in beds.
RIVER:They're doing it backwards; walking up the down slide.
JAYNE: (whispering, to SIMON) Keep her quiet.
SIMON: (whispering, to RIVER) This is the recovery ward. This is where patients come to get better.
RIVER: They're going to die.
SIMON: No one is going to die.
RIVER: (pointing to a bed) He is.
SIMON: (pushes down RIVER's hand) No he's not. That man standing next to him is his doctor. He's going to help him.
RIVER: He's not going to help him right.
SIMON: River, the doctors here are the best in the system. This is one of the top hospitals in the Core, or anywhere else.
RIVER: Where you should be.
RIVER looks at the patient she indicated as monitors start to beep wildly. She starts to rise from her wheelchair, and SIMON and JAYNE hold her down.
RIVER: You have to help him.
SIMON: River, we don't have time.
RIVER: (fighting JAYNE's grip) He's killing him!
CRASH_TEAM_NURSE: (in the b.g.) Code Blue.
SIMON: Stay here. Don't move.
SIMON runs toward patient in distress; JAYNE looks on angrily. SIMON breaks through the crowd at the bed.
SIMON: What do we have? (starts examining patient) 
YOUNG_INTERN: Forty-two year old double-bypass post-op, prognosis was positive.
CRASH_TEAM_NURSE: BP's 60/20, pulse is thready.
YOUNG_INTERN: Who are you?
CRASH_TEAM_NURSE: He's crashing.
SIMON: Get the cart.
CRASH_TEAM_NURSE: We have flatline.
YOUNG_INTERN: We've got to crack it.
SIMON: We're not cracking a post-op.
CRASH_TEAM_NURSE: He's non-responsive, should I call the code team?
SIMON: Get the infusers and point-four of atropine. 
SIMON: (to YOUNG INTERN) What did you give him?
YOUNG_INTERN: Just twenty of alprazoline push.
SIMON sighs disgustedly, holds syringe in his teeth, takes defib paddles.
SIMON: Clear. (looks at monitor) Clear. (monitor shows a heartbeat)
CRASH_TEAM_NURSE: (in b.g.) We've got rhythm.
YOUNG_INTERN: He's going tachy.
SIMON: Yeah, but his heart's beating.
SIMON injects the atropine, monitors stabilize, NURSE and YOUNG INTERN look on.
YOUNG_INTERN: He's okay.
RIVER smiles; JAYNE's expression is difficult to read.
SIMON: (confronts YOUNG INTERN) Explain to me how you justify administering a vasoconstrictor to this patient.
YOUNG_INTERN: Alprazoline is a pain killer, not a vaso --
SIMON: (interrupting) Unless you combine it with dilaftin. Which any first-year should know is the standard prep medication your patient was taking before surgery. Your patient should be dead.
SIMON walks back to JAYNE and RIVER.
SIMON: Let's go.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Back to MAL and ZOE and their problem DOCTOR.
POMPOUS_DOCTOR: Walk with me a minute.
MAL: Where're we going?
ZOE looks around, starts to walk away.
POMPOUS_DOCTOR: You see this badge? (turns to face MAL, points to his badge) It says 'doctor'. I say walk, you walk.
MAL: Yeah, but, where're we going?
POMPOUS_DOCTOR: You must be new. (ZOE walks up behind him) Don't get comfortable, your type never lasts long around here. When your supervisor hears about the rude and disrespect--ARGH!!!
The DOCTOR falls to the ground, revealing the defib paddles that ZOE is holding. MAL looks from the fallen DOCTOR to ZOE.
ZOE: (shrugging) Clear.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - NEUROIMAGING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
A large, empty room with a machine in the centre of the room, the function of which is not apparent, yet remains vaguely threatening. JAYNE, SIMON, and ZOE enter. JAYNE shuts the doors behind them.
SIMON: (to RIVER) Ready?
RIVER looks apprehensive, but nods.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
ZOE and MAL push the caskets down the hall and stop in front of the door to the medvault.
MAL: Twelve-oh-five. Here it is. (swipes his keycard, no go) Zoe.
ZOE takes MAL's place. She swipes her keycard, nothing happens.
ZOE: Must've been demagged.
MAL opens a casket, revealing the unconscious POMPOUS DOCTOR. MAL grabs his keycard and swipes it. The door opens, MAL and ZOE stand in the opening.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - NEUROIMAGING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
SIMON is gently lowering RIVER into the machine. SIMON goes to the controls, pressing some buttons. A humming fills the room, JAYNE backs away from the machine. RIVER closes her eyes stoically.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - MEDVAULT - CONTINUOUS
ZOE and MAL enter the medvault, pushing the gurneys before them. They open the caskets, MAL deposits the unconscious DOCTOR on the floor. ZOE starts scanning bottles, picking up the ones she wants and putting them in her casket. MAL pushes back his uniform sleeve, revealing a list of names written on his wrist. ZOE and MAL work quickly and silently until their caskets are full. They close the caskets and start to move out.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - NEUROIMAGING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
SIMON types instructions into the computer. A series of holographic images appear over RIVER - her skeletal system, her circulatory system, paring down until only her brain remains, hovering over her head.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
ZOE and MAL push the full caskets into the hallway.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - NEUROIMAGING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The computer screen informs us that it is downloading data. SIMON stands by RIVER's head, taking the holographic image between his fingers as if it were a picture and studying the changing angles.
SIMON: They opened up her skull. (JAYNE walks over to look) That's a scalpel scar. They... they opened up her skull and they cut into her brain.
JAYNE: (looks troubled) Why?
SIMON: The only reason to make an incision in someone's brain is to... lobotomize them. To go in and remove damaged tissue. Why... (deep breath) ...anyone would cut into a healthy brain is... They did it over and over... (studies the scan) They stripped her amygdala.
JAYNE: Her what?
SIMON: You know, ah, you know how you get scared or worried or nervous, but you don't want to be scared or worried or nervous, so you push it to the back of your mind? You try not to think about it. (cut to JAYNE's unreadable face) Your amygdala is what lets you do that. It's like a filter in your brain that keeps your feelings in check.
JAYNE reaches toward the image of RIVER's brain. SIMON stays his hand. JAYNE angrily jerks out of SIMON's grip.
SIMON: She feels everything; she can't not.
JAYNE: (looking around) Well, that's fascinating; let's get moving.
SIMON: We still have twenty minutes.
JAYNE: Oh, plan changed while you were out. We're meeting out the back way in five.
RIVER's brain hovers eerily above her head, phantom words scroll out beside the image.
SIMON: Well, I, I could use another couple minutes. I-I'm sure if we get in touch with Captain Reynolds--
RIVER opens her eyes; SIMON walks toward the computer.
JAYNE: Captain gave his orders, we play it by the book.
River SCREAMS.
JAYNE covers RIVER's mouth; SIMON shuts down the machine, grabs the information and comes over to RIVER. SIMON pushes JAYNE's hand away and gently cradles RIVER's face.
SIMON: River, River, shh, shh, it's okay. It's okay
JAYNE: Get her in the chair, let's go.
SIMON: Shh, shh, shh.
RIVER: No, no, no, they come out of the black. They come when you call.
JAYNE watches SIMON try to comfort RIVER.
SIMON: River, it's okay. It's over. We're leaving.
RIVER: Your toes are in the sand.
JAYNE: And you head's up your--
SIMON: (interrupting) Hey! Back off.
JAYNE: You just make sure she keeps her mouth shut. Don't need her screeching while we're trying to make a quiet getaway.
JAYNE opens the door while SIMON tries to calm RIVER while getting her up.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR
A crowded hallway. A subdued RIVER is being pushed by SIMON while JAYNE hurries them along.
SIMON: You should have let me know when the plan changed.
JAYNE: I told you when you needed to know. What are you griping about? You got what you came for.

INT. ARIEL CITY HOSPTIAL - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
A deserted hallway. JAYNE walks ahead of SIMON and RIVER.
RIVER: (distressed) No, no, I can't go back. I don't wanna go back.
JAYNE opens a door at the end of the hall.
SIMON: Shh, shh. It's okay. We're just going back to the ship. We're almost home.
RIVER and SIMON go through the door JAYNE is holding to,

EXT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - REAR EXIT - NIGHT
AGENT_MCGINNIS: Federal Marshals! Don't move! (a shotgun action is heard) River and Simon Tam, by the authority of the Union of Allied Planets, you are hereby bound by law. The feds close in on RIVER and SIMON.


EXT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - REAR EXIT - NIGHT
Right back where we left off.
AGENT_MCGINNIS: (to minions) Take them to Processing.
Minions grab SIMON and RIVER, cuffing their hands behind their backs. A minion grabs and cuffs JAYNE, who looks shocked. RIVER and SIMON are led away.
JAYNE: (whispering, to AGENT MCGINNIS) So, you gonna take me away for questioning now? How you wanna play it?
AGENT_MCGINNIS: You're under arrest for aiding and abetting Federal fugitives. Better get a lawyer.
JAYNE: You're kidding, right? What about my rutting money?
AGENT_MCGINNIS: You mean my money? For apprehending the three fugitives? I expect I'll be getting it soon.
JAYNE lunges for AGENT MCGINNIS, and is shot in the chest by a minion and falls to the ground, groaning.

EXT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - LANDING PAD - NIGHT
WASH is cooling his heels, sitting by the ambulance. ZOE and MAL come out of the hospital, pushing the loaded caskets.
WASH: (helping ZOE pick up a casket) How much did we get?
MAL: Enough to keep us flying.
ZOE: Can we fly somewhere with a beach?
WASH: Maybe a naked beach?
ZOE: Ooh.
WASH: Ahh.
ZOE and WASH have themselves some smoochies.
MAL: Cut it out. Job's not done until we're back on Serenity.
ZOE: Sorry, sir. Didn't mean to enjoy the moment.
MAL: (looking worried) Where are the others?
Now ZOE looks worried; WASH is still smiling.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - SECURITY SUBSTATION - CONTINUOUS
Federal Processing room. Minions push SIMON and JAYNE onto a bench; RIVER sits quietly beside them without being forced.
SIMON: (whispering, to JAYNE) If those officers hadn't been armed, I think you'd have had a chance.
JAYNE: A guy shoves me, I shove him. Not like I was trying to mount a rescue.
SIMON: Still. I appreciate you trying.
JAYNE: You know what I'd appreciate? You stop flapping that pretty mouth at me. I'm trying to figure a way out of here; can't do it with you yammering.
RIVER: They took Christmas away.
JAYNE and SIMON look over at her.
JAYNE: What the hell now?
RIVER: Came downstairs for the shiny presents. They took the tree and the stockings. Nothing left but coal.
JAYNE: (to SIMON) Will you shut her up!
RIVER: (smiling) Don't look in the closet, either. It's greedy. It's not in the spirit of the holiday.
JAYNE: (rolls his eyes) You shut the hell up, right now, or so help me, I will shut you up.

EXT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - LANDING PAD - NIGHT
MAL: Time?
ZOE: Ten minutes past rendezvous.
MAL: Something's happened.
WASH: (entering the ship) Kaylee, are you linked?

KAYLEE is on the radio.
KAYLEE: Uh... (punches some keys) I am now. What do you need?

INT. AMBULANCE SHIP - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
WASH: Find out if there's any kind of security alert in the hospital.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
KAYLEE: Hang on. (punches more keys)

EXT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - LANDING PAD - NIGHT
ZOE: Could be they're just late. 
MAL: Not this late. Jayne would have sent up a flag.
KAYLEE: (V.O.) Nothing from hospital security, nothing on the local pipeline, either.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
KAYLEE: Although I am getting some weird chatter from the official two-six-two. Sounds like...

EXT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - LANDING PAD - NIGHT
KAYLEE: (V.O.) ... They're talking about ducks.
ZOE: Code.
MAL: Feds got 'em. (to WASH) Have her bring up a hospital schematic on the Cortex. Find me a way into that security substation.
ZOE hands MAL a communicator and they put on the earpieces.
WASH: Wait a minute, you don't even know for sure if they're in there.
MAL: Gonna find out. (testing his com) Check.
ZOE: Coming in clear.
ZOE hands MAL a gun. Straps another gun to her ankle.
WASH: So, you're just going to walk in through the front door?
MAL: No. (chuckles) You're gonna find me a way around back.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - SECURITY SUBSTATION - CONTINUOUS
AGENT_MCGINNIS: Get up.
RIVER and JAYNE stand up, SIMON remains seated. AGENT MCGINNIS pushes JAYNE back down. JAYNE is not happy.
SIMON: What's going to happen to us?
AGENT_MCGINIS: I said, get up.
AGENT MCGINNIS pulls at SIMON's jacket, SIMON shrugs him off and stands up on his own. SIMON and FED are standing face to face.
SIMON: Agent McGinnis, I'm certain you're working under a superior who is keeping close tabs on this case. I'm certain of that because important people don't do field work. I'm also quite certain your superior wants me and my sister alive. Now, I'm not going to move from this spot until one of two things happens. You answer my very simple question; or you shoot me.
AGENT_MCGINNIS: (very precisely) We are transferring you into a holding area, until you can be retrieved.
SIMON: Retrieved? By whom?
RIVER looks distressed; JAYNE looks angry.
AGENT_MCGINNIS: People who want you alive. People not me. (to minions) Take them.
Two minions come and take RIVER, SIMON, and JAYNE into,

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS
JAYNE is led in first. He strikes out with his elbow, hitting the guard in the face; the second guard gets kicked in the stomach. JAYNE pins the first guard to the wall with his shoulder while SIMON does the same to the second guard. Both SIMON and the second guard fall to the ground, dazed. JAYNE knocks the first guard to the ground and cracks skull. JAYNE rolls away and brings his bound hands under his legs, his hands are still bound, but are now in front. RIVER looks on. JAYNE climbs on top of the first guard and starts throttling him. RIVER looks away, crying. The first guard manages to roll over until he is on top of JAYNE. The second guard starts to rouse, and SIMON presses a knee into his chest, holding him down. The first guard punches JAYNE a few times; then JAYNE regains top position, hauling the first guard to his feet. SIMON still holds the second guard immobile.

A smiling MAL and ZOE walk through a crowded hall.
MAL: (into his radio) Uh, Wash, we need a little direction here.

WASH: (to MAL) Working on it. 
WASH: (to KAYLEE) Kaylee, what do you got?

KAYLEE: Tell them to hand a left when they reach cryo. They'll see a door.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
MAL and ZOE rush toward a door.
WASH: (V.O.) Okay, go through that door, and down to green level.
ZOE and MAL hurry down a stairwell.
MAL: This is exactly what I didn't want. I wanted simple. I wanted in-and-out. I wanted easy money.
ZOE: Things always get a little more complicated, don't they, sir?
MAL: Just once I'd like things to go according to the gorram plan.
WASH: (V.O.) Uh, guys, you might wanna hurry.
MAL: (into radio) Oh, is there a problem?

EXT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - LANDING PAD - NIGHT
An Alliance ship touches down near the ambulance. WASH is looking at it through the window.
WASH: I think that reinforcements just arrived.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS
JAYNE and the first guard are still grappling, but JAYNE manages to snap the guard's neck. SIMON and RIVER look on, appalled. JAYNE staggers to the dead guard and takes the handcuff keys; unlocking himself, then SIMON, then RIVER. SIMON picks up the second guard's gun and hands it to JAYNE. SIMON grabs RIVER and they leave the cell, heading to the left. JAYNE heads to the right.
SIMON: What are you doing?
JAYNE: Going out the way we came in.
SIMON: There are at least four armed feds out there.
JAYNE: Six. I know.
SIMON: (pointing to the left) We run.
RIVER is watching the back and forth.
JAYNE: You got no idea where that goes.
SIMON: We'll find our way.
JAYNE: I ain't chancing that. I can handle the feds.
RIVER: (shaking her head) Doesn't matter. (JAYNE and SIMON look at RIVER) They're here.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - SECURITY SUBSTATION - CONTINUOUS
The Processing room. A minion motions to FED who looks over.
AGENT_MCGINNIS: Gentlemen, that was prompt. We're almost finished here. The prisoners will be out in a minute. Let me get the paperwork together for you.
AGENT_MCGINNIS: (to minion) Bobby, bring that here.
REVERSE camera to REVEAL that AGENT MCGINNIS is talking to two men in dark suits. We can see that one of them is wearing blue gloves, BLUE GLOVE #1. BLUE GLOVE #2 hangs back.
AGENT_MCGINNIS: Not that it will mean much. (sits) The men were tight lipped, the girl was just spewing gibberish. We got it all down.
BLUE_GLOVE_#1: (looks concerned) You spoke to the prisoners?
AGENT_MCGINNIS: Well, yeah. Had to process 'em. There was no interrogation, if that's what you mean. (BLUE GLOVE #2 comes forward) Didn't do your job for you.
BLUE_GLOVE_#2: Did your men also speak with them?
He is holding something that looks like a pen, but elongates with a snap to reveal an ominous glowing blue cylinder that extends from either side of his fist. A high-pitched hum emanates from it.
AGENT_MCGINNIS: As much as they had to.
AGENT MCGINNIS looks uncomfortable. He brings a hand to his nose, which is dripping a small amount of blood. The BLUE GLOVES are smiling genially. AGENT MCGINNIS starts choking and gagging. The cuticles on his fingernails are leaking blood. Blood pours from his, nose, eyes, mouth - he is in acute distress.
Is he gonna survive the supersonic boomstick? Not so much, we're thinking.


INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR
Hallway outside of holding cell. Distant screams can be heard. SIMON, RIVER and JAYNE look around uneasily.
JAYNE: What the hell is that?
RIVER whimpers.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - SECURITY SUBSTATION - CONTINUOUS
Processing room, now something of an abattoir. All the minions lie dead, covered with blood. The BLUE GLOVES walk calmly to the door.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
RIVER: (terrified) Two by two. Gloves of blue. Two by two. (JAYNE and SIMON look at her) Gloves... blue... two.
RIVER turns and runs crying down the hallway, SIMON runs after her. JAYNE looks up the stairwell for a moment, then follows.
The BLUE GLOVES walk through a door into the hallway our three heroes have just deserted.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - EMPTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
RIVER pushes open a heavy metal door, she runs across an empty room. SIMON and JAYNE are behind her.
JAYNE: (to SIMON) Where the hell's she going?
SIMON: There must be some sort of exit this way.
JAYNE: I don't see no exit.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS
BLUE_GLOVE_#1: (checking the first guard) Dead.
BLUE_GLOVE_#2: (checking the second guard) This one's alive.
He reaches into his pocket to remove the supersonic boomstick.

Back to the empty room with RIVER, SIMON, and JAYNE
JAYNE: I got no intention to run around like a rat in a maze 'til we're dead. Now, we're going back.
Someone screams in the distance. JAYNE looks back, gasps, and follows RIVER and SIMON.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS
The BLUE GLOVES step over the second guard, who is now very much not alive. They head down the hallway after the fugitives.

INT. ST. LUCY'S HOSPITAL - STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS
RIVER runs down it.
RIVER: Almost there. (another flight, we can see SIMON and JAYNE behind her) Almost there. (reaches the bottom) Almost there. (stops in front of a blue door) There.
JAYNE: (tries the door, locked) Stand back.
SIMON: (moves RIVER back) C'mere.
JAYNE: (shoots at door, rather unsatisfyingly) [Shee-niou - "shit urine"], high-tech Alliance crap.
JAYNE uses the gun butt to beat at the lock.

INTERCUT WITH:
There are a series of cuts between the blue door and the BLUE GLOVES. The BLUE GLOVES open the heavy door. SIMON and RIVER watch JAYNE beat at the blue door. The BLUE GLOVES walk across the empty room. JAYNE throws himself at the blue door. The BLUE GLOVES are getting closer. JAYNE keeps beating at the blue door, and a sudden blast blows through the lock. SIMON shields RIVER, JAYNE moves back, training his gun on the door. The door is kicked open, and there stands MAL and ZOE. JAYNE gasps; MAL beckons with a tilt of his head. The BLUE GLOVES reach the top of the stairs and look down to see an empty room and an open blue door.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
The cargo bay doors open, daylight hits INARA as she steps off her shuttle, and KAYLEE as she walks down the stairs.
KAYLEE: Oh, hey, there, Inara. How was your check-up?
INARA: Same as last year... What's going on here?
KAYLEE: (breezy) Oh, let's see... (counting on her fingers) We killed Simon and River... (INARA looks aghast) ...Stole a bunch of medicine, and now Zoe and the Captain are off springing the others that got snatched by the feds. (a vehicle approaches) Oh, here they are now.
The ambulance pulls into the bay. KAYLEE walks down the next set of stairs to push the button that closes the cargo bay door. MAL climbs out of the ambulance, goes to the cockpit window.
MAL: (to WASH) Tell me we weren't followed.
WASH: Nothing in our rearview the whole way back.
MAL: All right. Take us out of the world, as quick as you can.
WASH: (climbing out of the ambulance) We'll be out of atmo in five minutes.
MAL: (to INARA) Hey. How was your thing?
INARA: As advertised: lots of needles and cold exam tables. (beat) I heard you had some excitement.
MAL: Oh, nothing much. Lots of running around. A little gunplay. (walks toward JAYNE and KAYLEE) A couple of needles.
JAYNE: Next time we come to the Core, I'm staying with the Preacher.
MAL: (slaps JAYNE on the shoulder) Oh, you hadn't come you wouldn't be getting your big payday.
JAYNE looks a little confused. SIMON and RIVER walk up.
MAL: (to SIMON) So... (pulls KAYLEE into a back-to-front hug) Did you get what you needed?
SIMON: I think I did. I have the information I downloaded off the imager, I just have to go over it and then... Ah, I'm hopeful. (looks at RIVER, who smiles)
KAYLEE: (to JAYNE) What happened to your face?
JAYNE: - Huh?
KAYLEE motions to her eyebrow 'ow'. JAYNE reaches a hand halfway to the cut on his face before shrugging.
JAYNE: Oh, uh, nothing.
SIMON: He was amazing. I can't even begin to tell you.
SIMON slaps JAYNE's shoulder, JAYNE looks a little sick.
SIMON: We wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for him. (sincerely) Thank you.
JAYNE: Well, hey, you're part of my crew.
SIMON pats JAYNE's shoulder before letting go.
MAL: I think I might cry. (SIMON and KAYLEE laugh) All right, Jayne, help me with the cargo. Everyone, make yourself useful, you've got jobs to do, go do 'em.
Everyone walks away, leaving JAYNE and MAL alone by the ambulance.
JAYNE: (opening a casket) This's gotta be our best take ever.
MAL: Well, Doc had a good notion. The boy's got a decent criminal mind.
JAYNE grunts as he moves some cargo out of the way and then walks toward MAL.
JAYNE: So, what're you buying with your cut? MAL swings and hit JAYNE in the face. JAYNE falls to the floor. MAL looks down at JAYNE and the wrench he was holding drops to the deck. He looks quietly pissed as all hell.

JAYNE wakes on the floor of the cargo bay. There is a radio on the floor beside him. A door with a small diamond-shaped window is closing him in.
JAYNE: Hey! What the hell are you doing?
A finger taps on the window, then points down to the radio. JAYNE picks the radio up.

INT. SERENITY - INNER CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
MAL is pacing outside the door, talking into his own radio.
MAL: The job's done. Figured it was time for a little chat.
JAYNE pounds on the door controls to no avail. MAL hits the button that opens the exterior bay door.

INT. SERENITY - OUTER CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
JAYNE looks behind him as the noise of the engine, the sunshine, and the wind, flood the room.

INT. SERENITY - INNER CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
MAL: Seems to me we had a solid plan. Smooth, you might say. But what I can't figure out, is what you were doing 'round the back exit.
MAL leans against the door, we can see JAYNE's face through the window.
JAYNE: (V.O.) (on radio) What? I couldn't go out the front, I had to improvise. Open the damn door.
MAL: You called the feds.
JAYNE: (V.O.) (on radio) What? I got pinched!
MAL: Which is what happens when you call the feds.

INT. SERENITY - OUTER CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
JAYNE: (clinging to the door) No. I would never do that, my hand to god, may he strike me down as I'm standing here.

INT. SERENITY - OUTER CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
MAL: (V.O.) (over the radio) The minute we break atmo,

INT. SERENITY - INNER CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
MAL: You'll be a lot thinner once you get sucked out that hole. (gestures to opening bay door)
JAYNE: (door alarm goes off) Oh, come on, Mal.
SERENITY: (faintly heard over the wind) Leaving atmo in two minutes.
JAYNE: That ain't no way for a man to die.
SERENITY: (louder inside the ship) Secure cargo bay door at once.
JAYNE: (V.O.) You wanna kill me, shoot me. Just let me in.
MAL: You know, I hear tell they used to keelhaul traitors back in the day. I don't have a keel to haul you on, so...
JAYNE: (V.O.) Oh. Okay. I'm sorry, all right?
MAL: Sorry for what, Jayne?
MAL looks JAYNE in the face, through the window.
MAL: I thought you'd never do such a thing?
JAYNE: (V.O.) The money was too good. (MAL looks in at JAYNE.) I got stupid. (through the radio) I'm sorry, okay? Be reasonable. What're you taking this so personal for? It ain't like I ratted you out to the feds.
MAL: (angry) Oh, but you did. You turn on any of my crew, you turn on me. But since that's a concept you can't seem to wrap your head around, then you got no place here. (through the radio) You did it to me, Jayne. And that's a fact.
MAL walks away while JAYNE watches him through the window.
JAYNE: (V.O.) What're you gonna tell the others?
MAL: About what?
JAYNE: (V.O.) About why I'm dead.
MAL: (through the radio) I hadn't thought about it.
JAYNE: (V.O.) Make something up. Don't tell 'em what I did.
MAL stands still for a moment, looking at JAYNE. Then he presses the button that closes the outer bay door. The door closes.
MAL: (looking through the window) The next time you decide to stab me in the back... (through the radio) ...Have the guts to do it to my face.
MAL leaves the radio on the window, and walks up the stairs. JAYNE looks after him, shaken.
JAYNE: (through the radio) Can I come in?

INT. SERENITY - RIVER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
RIVER is drawing Russian nesting dolls. SIMON walks in, holding a syringe.
SIMON: Hi. (RIVER looks up) What are you doing?
RIVER: Drawing.
SIMON sits beside her, watching her draw.
SIMON: That's really good.
RIVER: (looking at the syringe) What are you doing?
SIMON: Oh, I, ah, brought some medicine. Do you remember why we went to the hospital?
RIVER: (sitting up) Time to go to sleep again.
SIMON: (softly) No, [mei mei - "little sister"]. (SIMON reaches down and takes RIVER's hand) It's time to wake up.
SIMON uncaps the syringe and looks down. RIVER watches him.


INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY
Simon is analyzing data on a vid screen. Book is moving about the infirmary behind him.
BOOK: Did you ever read the works of Shan Yu?
SIMON: Shan Yu, the psychotic dictator?
BOOK: Yep. Fancied himself quite the warrior-poet. Wrote volumes on war, torture... the limits of human endurance.
SIMON: (mildly) That's nice.
BOOK: He said... "Live with a man forty years. Share his house, his meals, speak on every subject. Then tie him up and hold him over the volcano's edge, and on that day, you will finally meet the man."
SIMON: What if you don't live near a volcano?
BOOK: I expect he was being poetical.
SIMON: Sadistic crap legitimized by florid prose. (beat) Tell me you're not a fan.
BOOK: I'm just wondering if they were. The people who did this to your sister.
SIMON: The government did this to her.
BOOK: The government is a body of people, usually notably ungoverned.
SIMON: Now you're quoting the Captain.
BOOK: I'm just wondering if they put her through this just to see how much she could take. To truly "meet her" as Shan Yu would have said.
SIMON: No, the more I see, the more I think their purpose was very specific. Look at this -- (shows Book an analysis of River's brain) -- the pattern. Besides, if all they cared about was hurting River, they wouldn't still be after her.
BOOK: But she's doing better.
SIMON: I've tried a couple different medications. She's sleeping better, but nothing really stable. I'll keep trying. Certainly got enough drugs on hand.
BOOK: Yes, I'd forgotten you're moonlighting as a criminal mastermind now. Got your next heist planned?
SIMON: No. But I'm thinking about growing a big black mustache. (beat; deadpan) I'm a traditionalist.

The TORTURER stops whipping.
NISKA: (to Torture Victim) So now we are past the preliminaries -- the little questions: why you skim from protection fund? How you could betray my trust. This we are past. Now we get to the real questions about who you truly are. (brandishes knife)
VIKTOR: (entering quietly) I'm sorry, sir.
NISKA: (annoyed) I get to heart of matter and always interruptions!
VIKTOR: One of our long-ranges picked up a read on the other side of the world. It might be Serenity. Malcolm Reynolds' ship.
NISKA: (excited) Oh. Oh, this is exciting news. Send a team. Bring him here to me.
VIKTOR: Yes, sir. (exits)

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
KAYLEE is chasing RIVER through the Cargo Bay. They are laughing and whooping like children.
MAL AND INARA stand up on the catwalk.

INT. SERENITY - CATWALK - CONTINUOUS
MAL: I said yes, already. Where's the outstanding issue?
INARA: The Councilor is an important political figure and a very private person...
MAL: So he visits you here instead of you going to his place. Fine. What, is the ship not clean enough?
MAL runs his hand along the catwalk railing like he's wearing white gloves and testing for dust.
INARA: I just want the Councilor to feel comfortable, and when I say comfortable, I mean totally alone. MAL looks a little confused, then his gaze is drawn to Kaylee and River, still laughing and running in the cargo bay.
MAL: Ah, the pitter patter of tiny feet in huge combat boots. (to Kaylee and River) Shut up! (to Inara) There's nobody sets foot on my boat that I don't meet 'em. (beat) Don't worry, I'm not gonna start any sword fights. I'm over that phase.
INARA: Well, I'd appreciate it if you could keep the others from ogling.
KAYLEE follows RIVER up the ladder into the catwalks.
MAL: One of you is gonna fall and die, and I'm not cleaning it up!
KAYLEE: She took my apple!
INARA: Jayne bought a crate of them.
KAYLEE: And this one's mine.
RIVER: Not anymore!
KAYLEE chases RIVER through a corridor and into

INT. SERENITY - KITCHEN AREA - CONTINUOUS
where she playfully wrestles the apple from River's hands.
KAYLEE: Okay. (holds apple aloft) No power in the 'verse can stop me.
Smiling, ZOE enters and sits down at the kitchen table, where WASH is already sitting, chomping on an apple.
ZOE: These really are the genuine article. I could get used to being rich.
WASH: It's Jayne being so generous with his cut that confuses and frightens me.
ZOE: It does kind of freeze the blood.
KAYLEE: Zoe, how come you always cut your apples?
WASH: (to Zoe) You do?
KAYLEE: Her and the Captain both. Whenever we get fresh fruit, they never just munch on 'em.
ZOE: Know what a Grizwald is?
JAYNE: (entering) It's a grenade.
ZOE: About the size of a battery. Responds to pressure. Our platoon was stuck in a trench outside of New Kasmir during the winter campaign. More'n a week, completely cut off, and the Alliance entrenched not ten yards away. We even got to talkin' to 'em, yelling across insults and jokes and such, 'cause no ammo to speak of, no orders, so what are you gonna do? We mentioned that we were out of rations, and ten minutes later, a bunch of apples rained into the trench.
WASH: (interrupting, to River and Kaylee) And they grew into a big tree, and they all climbed up the tree into a magical land with unicorns and a harp.
JAYNE approaches the table, opens his switchblade, and stabs it into one of the apples sitting in a bowl on the table. WASH startles. JAYNE retrieves his apple and moves toward the other end of the table.
KAYLEE: (beat) Blew off their heads, huh?
ZOE: Cap said wait, but they were so hungry. (beat) Don't make much noise. Just little pops and there's three guys that kind of just end at the ribcage.
WASH: (to River and Kaylee) But these apples are healthsome, good.
JAYNE: Yeah, grenades cost extra.
Mal enters, picking up an apple from the bowl on the table. Starts cutting it with a knife he picks up from a counter.
MAL: We are about 20,000 miles from our last drop, people, then we can take a break and think about spending some of this money.
Everyone responds with happy, affirmative, "Yeahs" and "All rights".
WASH: (sotto voce) Could've made more.
MAL: That wasn't a bad idea, Wash, but eliminating the middle man is never simple as it sounds.
WASH: (surprised) You heard about...?
MAL: About fifty percent of the human race is middle men and they don't take kindly to being eliminated. This quadrant, we play nice. We got enemies enough as it is.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
Wash is piloting. Zoe is sitting in the bridge near him. Yep, there's some tension.
WASH: So... when you said that you didn't get a chance to tell the Captain my idea...
ZOE: Mm-hmm?
WASH: What you actually meant was... you told him my idea, he rejected it out of hand, and you didn't argue the point or even give it another thought.
ZOE: I gave, honey, I-I --
WASH: And then came the lying to me about it, which for me is sort of the highlight of this little adventure.
ZOE: Is there any way I'm gonna get out of this with honor and dignity?
WASH: You're pretty much down to ritual suicide, lambie-toes.
ZOE: I didn't want to upset you.
WASH: What did you think of it?
ZOE: Of what?
WASH: My idea. Call the local MDs. Forget the fence, go straight to the source. Better prices, and we know the drugs get to the right people.
ZOE: (beat) The Captain thinks it'll get back to someone. Just cause trouble.
WASH: (angrily, in Chinese) [Tai-kong suo-yo duh shing-chiouh doh sai-jin wuh dhu pee-goo.] Was I ever not asking what the Captain thought!
ZOE: Well, I tend to agree with him.
WASH: Tend to, or have to? (beat) I love the fact that you two are old army buddies -- you have wacky stories that have ribcages in them, but could you have an opinion of your own, please?
ZOE: You're losing the high ground here, sweetcakes.
WASH: I'm sure you and Mal will take that hill and fortify it with --
ZOE: (interrupting) I thought your plan was too risky. I thought.
WASH: Then tell me. I am a large, semi-muscular man. I can take it. Don't hide behind Mal 'cause you know he'll shoot it down for you. Tell me.
ZOE: Right. Because what this marriage needs is one more shouting match.
WASH: No, what this marriage needs is one less husband. (beat) Right now it's kind of crowded.
WASH leaves the bridge. CLOSE IN on Zoe as she stands there, not knowing what the hell she's supposed to do.

The door slides open and Simon enters, seeing River sitting on a bunk.
SIMON: Whoa! [Mei-mei... - "little sister"...]
SIMON covers a shivering RIVER with a blanket.
SIMON: How you doing?
RIVER: I threw up.
SIMON: I'm sorry. It's a side effect. We just have to find the right treatment for you. How do you feel now?
RIVER: Going... Going back like... apple bits, coming back up. Chaos.
SIMON: But you felt okay this morning?
RIVER: Played with Kaylee. (smiles) Sun came out, and I walked on my feet and heard with my ears. I ate the bits, the bits stayed down, and I work. I function like I'm a girl. (upset) I hate it because I know it'll go away. The sun goes dark and chaos has come again. Bits. Fluids. What am I?!
SIMON: (hugs her) You are my beautiful sister.
RIVER: (sniffling): I threw up on your bed.
SIMON: (fuckity) Yep. Definitely my sister.

BOOK is reading a book, idly watching JAYNE and KAYLEE peeking around the doorway into the Cargo Bay.
BOOK: Didn't Inara express a wish for privacy?
KAYLEE: Oh... we've gotta see who she's got. Bet he's handsome. Think he's gonna bring her flowers.
JAYNE says nothing, simply taking a big bite out of his apple.

MAL AND INARA are awaiting the Councilor's arrival. A large man steps into the Cargo Bay.

KAYLEE: Oh! There he is!
BOOK looks up from his reading, standing up to join them at the doorway.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
Back to MAL AND INARA
MAL: Well, he looks the respectable sort.
MAL approaches the large man, hand out.
MAL: Welcome aboard. I'm Captain Malcolm Rey... The man completely ignores Mal. MAL stands there, surprised, hand still outstretched for a handshake.
THE MAN finishes casing the joint, and actives a comm.
MAN: We're all clear here, Councilor.
THE COUNCILOR enters the Cargo Bay. She's a very well-heeled and good-looking woman. Inara smiles and guides the Councilor upstairs. The crew? Pretty much stunned.
MAL: Huh.
BOOK: Oh, my.
KAYLEE: Oh, gosh, I... I-I knew she took females as clients... I just... (beat) They look so glamorous together.
JAYNE: (hella turned-on) I'll be in my bunk.

Zoe is preparing one of Serenity's shuttles for take-off.
MAL: Lucrative as this stuff is, I'll be glad to see the last of it. Kinda makes us a target for every--
ZOE: (interrupting) Was River in here messing around? The ignition sequence is all turned about. I can't even...
WASH: (entering) I can.
MAL: Well get it set, would you, Wash? We gotta get moving.
WASH: Here's a funny twist: no.
MAL: No what?
WASH: No, sir.
ZOE: Change the sequence?
WASH: Didn't want you taking off without me. In fact, didn't want you taking off at all. Thought I might take this run instead. Me and the Captain.
MAL: The Captain who's standing right here telling you that's not gonna happen?
WASH: Well, it's a dangerous mission, sir. I can't stand the thought of something happening that might cause you two to come back with another thrilling tale of bonding and adventure. I just can't take that right now.
MAL: Okay, um, I'm lost. Uh, I'm angry, and I'm armed, so if you two have something that you need to work out -- 
ZOE: It's all right, sir. We've deal with Bolles before. Shouldn't be a problem. (beat; to Wash) And I wouldn't mind sitting this one out.
MAL: (unamused) Oh, this is a fine [fang-tzang fong-kwong duh zie] but I don't have time to unwind it. Wash. (beat) Get her started. Zoe, ship is yours.
ZOE exits.
WASH: Bye, hon! We promise not to stop for beers with the fellas! WASH sits down, starts the engines.
WASH: (to Mal) So, are we gonna sing army songs, or something?
MAL is beyond annoyed at this point.

The COUNCILOR is lying face-down on the bed, nude, covered from the hips down by a sheet. INARA is giving her a back massage.
COUNCILOR: (relaxed) Mmm. That feels amazing. (beat; Inara smiles) Oh, right there. That's perfect. I should have done this weeks ago.
INARA: I wouldn't have been here weeks ago.
COUNCILOR: And that would have been a shame.
INARA: For me as well. (beat) You have such beautiful skin.
The COUNCILOR sits up a bit on her elbows and looks over her shoulder at INARA.
COUNCILOR: There's no need for the show, Inara. I just need to relax with someone who's making no demands on me.
INARA: Most of my clientele is male. Do you know that?
COUNCILOR: No.
INARA: (caressing Councilor) If I choose a woman, she tends to be extraordinary in some way. And the fact is, I occasionally have the exact same need you do. One cannot always be one's self in the company of men.
COUNCILOR: (smiling) Never, actually.
INARA: So no show. Let's just... enjoy ourselves.
COUNCILOR: You are so lovely.
INARA and the COUNCILOR both lean forward and kiss -- by the sounds of it, it's sweet and passionate, although it's mostly blocked by the long fall of Inara's hair.

Wash is in the driver's seat, Mal riding shotgun, and it's damn bright inside that shuttle -- making Mal and Wash all squinty.
MAL: Look, this thing with you and Zoe...
WASH: Really not looking to talk on that topic.
MAL: Hey. I let that [niou-se - "urine-shit"] trick of yours slide because this is a milk run. But when I go on a mission, I'm taking Zoe and that's the drill. You know that. I mean, what happens if we get into a situation here?
WASH: Hey, I've been in a firefight before! (off Mal's look) Well, I was in a fire. (beat) Actually, I was fired from a fry-cook opportunity. (beat) I can handle myself.
MAL: And you understand what Zoe's job entails?
WASH: I'll learn as I go.

EXT. PLANET - DAY - CONTINUOUS
MAL walks easily across the sand, WASH trailing behind him, hauling a heavy plastic box and breathing a little heavy. Three armed bandity guys approach from the other direction, the one in front presumably BOLLES.
WASH: So now I'm learning about carrying.
MAL and WASH finally meet up with the BOLLES and his guys, stopping a few feet apart. WASH puts down the heavy plastic box and flips back the lid, revealing a big pile of drugs. BOLLES looks impressed.
BOLLES: Nice to know you're still trustworthy.
MAL: I'm not so trustworthy I don't want to see the money you promised me.
BOLLES holds up his hand. Bolles' guy puts a bag of coin into it. BOLLES tosses it to Mal, who opens up the bag to take a look.
BOLLES hooks his thumbs into his belt, feelin' chatty.
BOLLES: Man, can't believe you guys knocked over an Alliance hospital. The pair you have.
WASH smiles. MAL's still all business.
MAL: Yeah, the stuff legends are made of...
MAL looks up and sees a red dot on BOLLES' forehead.
It's a laser sight.
MAL: [Tzao-gao! - "Oh, shit!"] 
A SHOT is fired. It hits BOLLES square between the eyes and he goes down, dead.
MAL hits the dirt, wrapping his arm around Wash's middle and taking Wash down with him.
BOLLES' two guys are quickly taken out by sniper fire. While MAL and WASH stay down, several snipers rise from their cover and surround them.
WASH: Now I'm learning about scary.


INT. SERENITY - COMMON AREA
BOOK is lifting a weighted barbell. JAYNE stands by the bench with a towel over his shoulder, spotting him. JAYNE's attention is suddenly caught by the sound of laughter.
INARA AND THE COUNCILOR are coming down the catwalk stairs, all smiles.
While JAYNE watches Inara and the Councilor hug and kiss good-bye, hella turned-on again, BOOK struggles with the barbell he's lifting, groaning faintly with effort.
The COUNCILOR and her GUARD exit Serenity. INARA closes the Cargo Bay doors and turns to see JAYNE leering. She rolls her eyes and heads back upstairs.
JAYNE finally reaches out with one hand and helps Book return the barbell to its rest.
JAYNE: I'll be in my bunk. (starts to exit)
ZOE: (entering) Jayne, grab your weapon.
JAYNE: Why? What's goin' on?
ZOE: Maybe nothing. Maybe trouble.
JAYNE: The drop?
ZOE: They're late. They should've been back more'n an hour ago. (beat) We go by ground. We'll take the mule.
BOOK: I'll go with you.
ZOE: No offense, Shepherd, but I sure as hell hope they don't need a preacher.
BOOK: Three sets of eyes are better than two. Might see something you don't.
ZOE considers this.
ZOE: Let's move.
JAYNE and BOOK follow Zoe.

EXT. PLANET - DAY - CONTINUOUS
ZOE, JAYNE and BOOK are at the drop site, examining the bodies of BOLLES and his men, flipping them over to identify them.
JAYNE: None of 'em's ours.
BOOK: This is precision work: sharpshooters. From the look of these wounds, I'd say a 54-R sniper rifle, laser sights.
JAYNE: You do a lot of shooting at the abbey there, Shepherd?
BOOK: (dryly) Rabbits.
JAYNE: For stew, sure.
JAYNE harvests some guns off the corpses and sticks them in his gun belt. ZOE's off tracking.
ZOE: Whoever did this, they weren't after the goods.
CLOSE on the spilled container of drugs Wash was carrying. JAYNE looks up, starts walking toward the camera. ZOE and BOOK follow.
JAYNE: We ain't gonna find 'em here. They're off planet already. (re: black streak in the sand) Only one type of transport I know makes a mark like this.
ZOE: Fast burn rocket shuttle.
BOOK: Craft like that not commonly part of a ship. More likely we're looking at --
ZOE: Space station.
BOOK: Yeah.
ZOE: (beat) I know who's got 'em.

INT. SPACE STATION - NISKA'S TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
WASH and MAL, blindfolded and with their hands bound behind their backs, are herded into a dark room by two guards. The two guards shut the door behind them. While throughout this scene WASH just stands there and panics, MAL is slowly casing the joint, blindly feeling his way around the room to assess its dimensions and dangers.
MAL: You okay?
WASH: (panicky) I think I've been kidnapped.
MAL: Yeah.
WASH: You see where we are?
MAL: No.
WASH: Mal, what the hell is going on?
MAL: Ain't rightly sure.
WASH: But you've got some theories.
MAL: Still working it through.
WASH: I don't want you to spare me, Mal. If you think you know what's happening, then you tell me. You wouldn't spare Zoe if she were in this situation with you, would you? You would be planning, and plotting and... possibly scheming. So whatever Zoe would do in this instance is what I wanna do. Do you know why? No matter how ugly it gets, you two always come back with the stories. So... I'm Zoe. Now, what do I do?
MAL: Probably not talk quite so much.
WASH: Right. Less talking. (beat; still panicky) She's terse. I can be terse. (beat) Once in flight school, I was laconic.
WASH keeps the silence for a couple of seconds, then blurts,
WASH: If I'm not gonna talk then you have to. What else?
MAL: We just gotta keep our heads.
WASH: Right. "Keep our heads." That way we'll be able to... you know... keep our heads. (beat) You and Zoe have been in plenty of situations like this before, right?
MAL: (lying) Many a time.
WASH: Many a time, you and Zoe...
MAL: Once we know who it was took us --
WASH: Zoe and you together in a tricky... (hey, wait) Mal, she's my wife!
MAL: Huh?
WASH: What gives you the right to put her in a dangerous situation like this?!
MAL: I didn't.
WASH: You did!
MAL: She ain't here, Wash.
WASH: No, but she would have been!
MAL: Okay.
WASH: I mean, I'm the one she swore to love, honor and obey.
MAL: Listen... (beat) She swore to obey?
WASH: Well, no, not... (beat) But that's just my point! You she obeys! She obeys you! There's obeying going on right under my nose!
MAL: Look, Zoe and I have a history. She trusts me.
WASH: What's that supposed to mean?
MAL: Don't mean a thing, but you're making out like she blindly follows my every word. That ain't true!
WASH: Sure it is!
MAL: Not so. There's plenty orders of mine that she didn't obey.
WASH: Name one!
MAL: She married you!
The door screeches open, breaking the tense moment. NISKA enters with VIKTOR. NISKA goes to MAL, takes off the blindfold. NISKA grins in MAL's face. MAL is... kinda unpleasantly surprised.
MAL: [Tah-mah-duh huun-dan. - "Mother-humping son of a bitch."]
WASH: What?

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
The crew, minus Mal and Wash, are gathered, handing ZOE their money.
KAYLEE: Here's all I got left.
ZOE: Thanks. (yells) Jayne!
BOOK: How do you know he won't just grab you as well?
ZOE: Don't think that's like to happen. I walk in there unarmed, make the offer. This guy has his own code, twisted as it may be. Very excited about reputation. He'll see reason.
INARA: Reason? He's a gangster. The money he paid you for that other job -- it was already returned to him.
JAYNE: (entering) Could be he's harboring some resentment at us for putting his man through our engine.
ZOE: (beat) Wait a reasonable amount of time, but if you don't hear back, I want you to take Serenity and get out of this quadrant. This don't play out right, there's no guarantee he won't come looking for the rest of you.

INT. SPACE STATION - NISKA'S TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
MAL and WASH are tied back-to-back, both being electrocuted via electrodes on their chests. MAL and WASH are not yet screaming, but they're in some serious pain. (Their conversation throughout this scene is accompanied by heavy breathing, slurring of words, and groans of pain.) NISKA looks on with delight while the TORTURER mans the electricity. Electricity shuts off.
MAL: I'm not... gonna say it... again. Shipboard romances complicate things...
WASH: For who? For you?
MAL: For everyone.
WASH: Well, what about lov--
There go the electrodes again, painfully zapping MAL and WASH. And off again.
MAL: I ain't against it as a rule... but in situations such as ours, it tends to cause problems. It splits loyalties. 
WASH: Know what I think?
MAL: What?
There go the electrodes again, zapping MAL and WASH. WASH is starting to falter a little, sagging when the electricity shuts off.
MAL: What, Wash? What do you think? Because I'm interested.
WASH: (weakly) This "policy" you got against shipboard relationships -- that's just you projecting your own intimacy issues on everyone else.
And NISKA signals for the electrodes again. WASH and MAL shake and writhe in pain until the electricity goes off.
MAL: 'Course, could be a lot simpler than that. Could be I just don't think you're good enough for Zoe.
WASH: And I don't give a good gorram what you think.
MAL: Oh, don't you? Zoe and I, we got a history, and I figure you gotta be asking yourself some fundamental questions as to the nature of that history.
WASH: You never slept with my wife.
MAL: Oh? That a fact? You know that for sure, do you? You ever ask her?
And the electrodes go off again, making WASH and MAL shake in pain. When the electricity shuts off, WASH's head is hanging.
MAL: Hey. We been together for a long time before you came along, Wash. And she's a damn fine-looking woman. (laughs)
WASH: (weakly) Never happened. Know how I know?
MAL: How? Tell me.
WASH: This whole Captain thing isn't Zoe's trouble. It's the-guy-she-never-slept-with thing. Hell, Mal, I wish you had slept with her. Then at least she'd be over it.
MAL: Oh, you want me to sleep with her? Would that make you feel better?
WASH: It might.
MAL: Oh, I'd imagine it would do wonders for her, too.
WASH: Screw you!
MAL: Get in line.
And there go the electrodes again. When the electrodes shut off, Wash slumps down, nearly unconscious, and pretty damn dazed.
MAL: Okay, Wash, I'm gonna do it. (alarmed) Wash! Wash, listen. First thing we do when we get back... (panicky) Listen to me! (beat) First thing when we get back, I'm gonna... I'm gonna take your wife into my bed. 
WASH: (weakly) Yeah?
MAL: (relieved Wash is awake) I'm gonna get me a piece of --
And we're back to the torture.

INT. SPACE STATION - NISKA'S TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
At the center of the room are MAL and WASH, tied-up and looking terrible. NISKA grins off to the left. ZOE walks into the room, her expression impassive.
WASH: (weakly) No, no, no, no... Run, run...
ZOE approaches NISKA.
ZOE: It's five times what you paid us for the train job.
NISKA: Yes. You have had, you say it, good times... I see that.
ZOE: Should be more than enough to buy back my men.
NISKA: This is your opinion, is it?
ZOE: It is.
NISKA: They are perhaps damaged now. Are they worth so much to you?
ZOE: Yes.
NISKA: And to me, they are worth more. I think this is not enough. Not enough for two. But sufficient, perhaps for one. (beat, smiling) Ah... you now have --
ZOE: (immediately) Him.
ZOE points to WASH.
ZOE: (to Niska) I'm sorry. You were going to ask me to choose, right? Did you want to finish?

NISKA: He is yours. We are ended now.
ZOE drapes WASH's arm over her shoulders and supports his weight. WASH can barely walk.
WASH: Mal...
WASH looks over his shoulder at MAL. MAL shakes his head.
ZOE: Shh. Just keep walking.
NISKA waits until WASH and ZOE are at the doorway to say:
NISKA: A moment, please.
ZOE and WASH carefully turn. ZOE props WASH up against the door frame.
NISKA: This money, it is too much.
NISKA speaks in Czech to TORTURER.
NISKA: You should have some small refund.
The TORTURER takes a BIG KNIFE and CUTS OFF MAL's left ear. ZOE watches impassively. WASH turns his head.
MAL SCREAMS.
NISKA takes MAL's ear and wraps it in a white cloth. He hands it to ZOE.
NISKA: Now we are ended.
Without a word or a blink, ZOE takes the cloth holding Mal's ear and tucks it into her vest. Then, as MAL SCREAMS, she supports WASH as they walk away from the torture chamber.

ZOE helps WASH into the shuttle. WASH goes down on his knees. ZOE joins him on the floor, comforting him as best she can.

ZOE: You mean Mal?
WASH: He's crazy. He wouldn't break, Zoe. (beat) He kept me from...
ZOE: It's okay.
WASH: I wouldn't have made it.
ZOE: Shh...
WASH: Niska's gonna kill him.
ZOE: He's gonna make it last as long as possible. Days, if he can.
WASH is struck by this. He stands up with great effort.
WASH: Bastard's not gonna get days.
WASH moves to the pilot's seat and fires up the shuttle.

WASH: I'm fine.
WASH brushes past Simon.
INARA: Where's Mal?
ZOE: Niska wouldn't let him go.
INARA: Is he alive?
ZOE: For now. (to Simon) Take that to the infirmary. Put it on ice.
ZOE hands Simon the white cloth containing MAL's ear and follows WASH.
KAYLEE: Wh-wh-what is that?
SIMON unwraps the cloth to reveal MAL's ear. INARA and KAYLEE gasp.
SIMON: It's his ear.
BOOK: [Huh choo-shang tza-jiao duh tzang-huo - "Animal-fucking bastard."]
ZOE: We're getting him back.
JAYNE: What are we gonna do, clone him?
SIMON: Well, it's a clean cut. With the right equipment, I should be able to reattach it. (beat) That's assuming there's a head.

NISKA: Do you know the writings of Shan Yu?
MAL: (groaning) We're starting a book club? What? Are you trying to tor -- (cries out) ...trying to torture me?
NISKA laughs.
NISKA: Yes, today we meet you. Yes, and you are quite a man. An extraordinary man. Yes, but these are not times for extraordinary men. Business is not war. Heroics are unseemly. They complicate.
NISKA crosses the room and takes out a black device.
NISKA: For you, I have, uh... special machine...
NISKA pets the black device.
NISKA: Very precious.
MAL: (with effort) And they say people don't look like their pets.
NISKA: (chuckles) Let us see if we can meet the real you.
The TORTURER smiles a bit evilly and a metallic whirring sound starts up. The TORTURER attaches the device to Mal's chest and it crawls and claws inside, almost like a metallic spider.
MAL SCREAMS, long and loud.

WASH and ZOE are loading up enough weapons for a small army. ZOE finishes loading a gun and hands it to WASH.
ZOE: Here. Six shots, and then just drop it. Keep moving.
JAYNE: (from doorway) This here's suicide. You do know that, don't you? (beat) You really think you can mount a two-man frontal assault on Niska's skyplex and live?
WASH: Technically, it's a one-man/one-woman assault. A unisex. (to Zoe) Grenades?
ZOE: Oh, yes. Thank you, dear. (to Jayne) He won't be expecting it.
JAYNE: Right. 'Cause they ain't insane.
KAYLEE: (entering) Uh, I just got a wave from Inara. No luck with the Councilor. (to Jayne) What are they doin'?
JAYNE: Fixin' to get themselves killed.
ZOE: We're gonna go get the Captain.
KAYLEE: Oh. Good! (to Jayne) Can they do that?
JAYNE: No.
WASH: You know, there's a certain motto. A creed among folks like us. You may have heard it: "Leave no man behind."
WASH finishes loading a tiny pistol and cocks it. Oh, the ironical sight gag.
JAYNE: Suicide.

INT. SERENITY - CORRIDOR - CONTINOUS
WASH and ZOE are fully armed and leaving the kitchen area.

ZOE: What's this?
SIMON: We're going with you.
KAYLEE: If it were any one of us, Cap'n wouldn't hesitate.
BOOK: (handing off a handgun) Here you go. (removing a semi-automatic from locker) This should do.
ZOE: Preacher, don't the Bible have some pretty specific things to say about killing?
BOOK: Quite specific. (beat) It is, however, somewhat fuzzier on the subject of kneecaps.
ZOE: If you're looking for me to talk you out of it --
Everyone looks up at the sound of a gun cocking. JAYNE is standing at the top of the stairs with Vera. When he sees everyone looking, he glances down at his zipper.
JAYNE: What?
ZOE looks at WASH.
ZOE: Let's go get the Captain.

TORTURER: Yep. He's dead.

MAL is lying on his back, chest bloody. There is an electronic whine and the TORTURER applies a defibrillator to MAL's chest. Eventually, MAL's eyes pop open and he breathes.
NISKA: (sing-song) Mr. Reynolds? (beat) You died, Mr. Reynolds. 
MAL: Seemed like the thing to do.
NISKA: When you die, I can't hurt you anymore and I want two days, at least. Minimum. I think many people know the name Malcolm Reynolds. Many know he crossed Niska. They must know what happens after that.
NISKA nods at the torturer, who comes forward with a big, nasty torture device that looks like scissors.
NISKA: They must know that business is still running.
MAL turns his head away from the scissors.

JAYNE: You really think this'll work?
WASH: Well, except for the comm static, I'm piping out on all frequencies. We've been completely powered down since I fired the attitude thrusters a half hour ago. We should show up on their screens as a radar glitch if they aren't looking too close.
JAYNE: What if they are looking too close?
WASH: Hell, I'm just glad we're on course.
ZOE: It's like throwing a dart, Jayne, and hitting a bulls-eye 6,000 miles away. (proudly) That's my man.
WASH: You guys better get down to the bay. We'll be at their front door in less than a minute.
JAYNE exits. ZOE squeezes WASH's shoulder.

BOOK: Yes, ma'am. Ready when you are.
ZOE: Kaylee, how you doing on that override sequence?
KAYLEE: Pretty sure this'll pop their airlock doors if Wash can get a seal on the first try.
JAYNE: Smellin' a lot of "if" comin' off this plan.
ZOE: You coulda stayed in your bunk.
JAYNE: Coulda, shoulda, woulda. (cocks Vera)
WASH comes down the stairs, calling out:
WASH: We're set.
ZOE: Okay, people... If it moves, shoot it.

ZOE: Unless it's the Captain.
They all move toward the cargo bay door.

Three guards stand in front of the opening bay door. As the door opens, they're blinding by a bright light coming from Serenity's cargo bay. An ENGINE REVS, and then the four-wheel mule speeds off Serenity's cargo bay and into the space station, prompting the blinded guards to shoot at it.
The mule crashes into a guard and explodes.
JAYNE, ZOE, and WASH advance down the ramp into the space station, shooting. ZOE tosses a grenade around the corner into a corridor.
MIXED SHOUTS of "Move, move, move" and "Take cover!" sound before the grenade blasts. One of the guards stumbles out of the corridor, his back on fire.
ZOE: Second team!
BOOK, KAYLEE AND SIMON advance down the ramp.
ZOE: Hold this position! We lose this position, we lose it all. You're going to hold this ground. (beat) Understand me?
BOOK fires at a guard advancing down the hallway. Hits the guard in the kneecap, prompting the guard to fall forward and crack his head open on a jutting piece of the mule.
BOOK: Understood.
ZOE: Okay, then.
JAYNE advances down the hallway, firing a pistol at advancing guards. ZOE and WASH follow. BOOK takes up position.

NISKA: Viktor, what is this? Viktor!
Suddenly, the TORTURER arches his back and screams, falling to his knees to REVEAL
MAL standing behind him.
MAL's attached the little black torture device that killed him to the TORTURER's back.
MAL steps over the TORTURER's writhing body and PUNCHES Niska in the face. NISKA falls to the floor.
MAL: Looks like business ain't running so much as crawlin' away. (angrily) You want to meet the real me now?

INT. SPACE STATION - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
JAYNE is leaning out from his cover to fire at the guards and takes a shot in the left shoulder.
JAYNE: Ah! Ah, gorram it.
ZOE advances up the corridor. A guard pops out from cover and ZOE barrel rolls, pulling two handguns from her shoulder holsters as she rises, nailing the guard in the chest.

INT. SPACE STATION - DOCKING BAY DOORS - CONTINUOUS
BOOK is firing upon the advancing guards. SIMON and KAYLEE are looking distinctly nervous.
SIMON: Book, we, uh...
Guards are advancing Simon's way. He shoots, but misses. BOOK ducks from behind his cover and takes out one of the advancing guards.
JAYNE: (O.S.) Get behind us, Preacher! We need cover!
BOOK jerks his head at his position, taking off down the hallway. SIMON nervously takes up BOOK's position.
BOOK: (to Simon) Don't think. Just shoot.
More guards advance. KAYLEE can't deal with it. She freaks and runs back into Serenity. RIVER joins her at the ramp, takes one glance out at the three guards, then picks up Kaylee's abandoned pistol.
RIVER: (chanting) Can't look. Can't look.
RIVER suddenly stands up and fires three times.
Silence.
KAYLEE stands and peers out at the docking bay. All three guards are now dead. KAYLEE looks at RIVER.
RIVER: (smiling faintly) No power in the 'verse can stop me.

INT. SPACE STATION - TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
MAL is beating up NISKA when the TORTURER grabs MAL from behind. They grapple and end up falling backward out a glass window leading to the huge shaft we saw earlier in the episode.
The TORTURER is strangling MAL with a length of cord.
MAL: (strangled) Haven't you killed me enough for one day?

INT. SPACE STATION - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
ZOE, JAYNE and WASH advance to the doorway of the torture chamber. ZOE pulls the door open, and we're,

INT. SPACE STATION - TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
JAYNE, ZOE, and WASH advance, see the Captain being strangled outside on the narrow balcony surrounding the huge processing shaft.
JAYNE raises his pistol. ZOE puts her hand on his arm.
ZOE: Jayne. This is something the Captain has to do for himself.
MAL: (strangled) No! No, it's not!
ZOE: (oops) Oh.
ZOE, JAYNE and WASH all shoot at the TORTURER. The TORTURER falls over the edge of the balcony and tumbles to his death.

EXT. PLANET - SERENITY - DAY
Establishing shot of Serenity.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
SIMON is packing up medical supplies when a battered MAL enters the cargo bay. He can't seem to stop touching his mended ear.
MAL: Sure this thing's gonna stay on?
SIMON: This dermal mender creates an excellent tissue bond. It should be fine. Just don't... don't fiddle with it.
MAL: (to Inara) Be sure to, uh, thank the Councilor for me. Awful nice of her to... pull some strings and lend us this equipment.
INARA: It's the least she could do. I just wish you'd killed that old bastard.
MAL: I got regrets on that score my own self. (beat) So. I hear you all took up arms in that little piece of action back there. (to Simon) How you faring with that, doctor?
SIMON: I don't know. I, uh... I never-never shot anyone before.
BOOK: I was there, son. I'm fair sure you haven't shot anyone yet.
MAL chuckles and heads up the stairs, squeezing KAYLEE's hand as he goes past. A moment later, KAYLEE turns back to see RIVER standing in the catwalks. KAYLEE's obviously uncomfortable.

INT. SERENITY - KITCHEN AREA - CONTINUOUS
WASH sits at the table. ZOE is at the counter behind him dishing up food. She comes around the corner and sets a bowl in front of Wash, shaking out his napkin and tucking it into his shirt.
WASH: Mmm. Wife soup.
ZOE chuckles.
WASH: I must've done good.
ZOE: Yes, dear. You done good.
ZOE smooches Wash's cheek and puts her arms around his neck.
There's a PAINED GROAN as MAL enters the kitchen area. ZOE lets go of Wash.
MAL: Did you tell her?
WASH: Tell her what?
MAL: (to Zoe) Your husband has demanded that we sleep together.
ZOE: Really?
WASH: What? Mal, come on.
MAL: He seems to think it would get all this burning sexual tension out in the open -- you know, make a fair fight for your womanly affections.
WASH: No. That was the torture talking. Remember? The torture?
MAL takes Zoe's hands. Puts one on his hip, the other on his shoulder.
MAL: (deadpan) I know it's a difficult mission... but you and I... have to get it on.
ZOE: I understand. We have no choice.
ZOE and MAL stand about a foot apart, staring at each other. Absolutely nothing resembling The Sexy is happening.
JAYNE walks into the kitchen area just in time to hear:
ZOE: (deadpan) Take me, sir. Take me hard.
JAYNE: Now somethin' about that is just downright unsettling.
WASH throws down his napkin as MAL and ZOE mock-struggle to kiss each other from a foot away. WASH grabs ZOE and escorts her to the door.
WASH: We'll be in our bunk.
WASH playfully smacks ZOE's behind as they walk out of the kitchen.
Disconcerted, JAYNE turns around and walks toward the dinner table. MAL is slowly, painfully pulling out a chair.
JAYNE: Oh, hey.
JAYNE smacks the back of his hand against MAL's belly, sitting down at the table where Wash was sitting.
JAYNE: Free soup.
MAL makes a tiny grunt of intense pain and freezes, glaring at Jayne.


EXT. SPACE-
We are in deep space. A planet comes into frame from above, and we rocket towards it, past it to a circling moon, closer, see the landmasses, the landscape come all the way down toward a glittering house in the desert --
 
EXT. HEART OF GOLD BORDELLO - DAY
A plain but statley-in-its-own-way multi-storied wood frame structure, alone and secluded on this pleasant moon.
A PRETTY GIRL (late teens) and a PRETTY BOY (same age) are currently out front, hanging the laundry. Sheets. They giggle and laugh. Picture perfect country tranquility. They react to the SOUND of POUNDING HORSE HOOVES...

THROUGH THE BILLOWING SHEETS
HORSES on the horizon. Coming up fast over a rise. And now, in between them, bouncing up INTO VIEW -- A HOVERCRAFT, a badass SPACE JEEP, zooming over its buffeting hover-current.
THE BOY AND GIRL register recognition. React --
PRETTY_GIRL: Nandi! NANDI!
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, early 30's, NANDI, the madam of this concern, appears from the house. Sees the trouble approaching in the distance.
NANDI: Get inside.
But they are frozen to the spot as the riders and hovercraft get closer. Some other GIRLS are appearing variously at the door and windows. All of them are varying degrees of pretty -- prostititutes.
NANDI: GO!
The frightened girl and boy head in. Nandi mentally runs through her options. There is only one: stand tough. The horses gallop up. She is immovable.
NANDI: We ain't open for business.
The HOVERCRAFT glides to a stop. Piloting it is RANCE BURGESS. A handsome, fancified imperious GENTLEMAN. But he's anything but gentle...
BURGESS: Shut up, whore.
NANDI: And you we don't trade with at all, Rance Burgess. You're no longer welcome in this establishment. You been told that.
BURGESS: I've been told a great many things. I'm here for what's mine.
NANDI: Ain't nothing here belongs to you. You don't get gone, we'll be well within our rights to drop you.
BURGESS: Only rights you got are the ones I give you. (to his men) Find the girl.
The horsemen move to the door, push their way in.
NANDI: She ain't here. Girl left this moon more'n a month ago. It was you chased her off.
Nandi is poker-faced. Some SCREAMING and CRYING from inside. Crying he recognizes. He smiles at the stone-faced Nandi.
Rance's men now hustle a struggling GIRL out through the door -- young PETALINE. She'd be the picture of scrubbed wholesomeness -- except for the fact that she's very, very pregnant. 'bout ready to pop. She's terrified. They force her to her knees.
BURGESS: Petaline. It's a good thing you haven't left with my baby.
PETALINE: This baby ain't yours!
BURGESS: So you keep saying.
He nods to his men, who rip open Petaline's dress, exposing her belly. Rance pulls a FUTURISTIC HYPO DEVICE from his coat, plunges it into her belly. She winces and gasps in sudden pain. He brings the device away from her.
BURGESS: If this DNA is a match with mine -- know I will be back for my baby.
Rance places a hand on Petaline's face.
BURGESS: And if I have to, I'll cut it out of ya.
Rance climbs on his hoverdraft, his men to their horses. They go. Nandi and some of the other girls move to Petaline, who's quietly sobbing. Help her to her feet.
NANDI: Shhh. Quiet, now. It'll all work out.
Among the whores helping to steady Petaline are CHARI, a petite and refined prostitute, maybe the prettiest one here, and HELEN, a more hardy whore. They watch the men leaving.
CHARI: He'll do it too. He'll do what he says.
NANDI: No he won't. We won't allow it.
HELEN: How we gonna stop him, Nandi?
NANDI: We'll get help. That's how.
CHARI: Help? There's not a soul on this moon'd go up against Rance Burgess.
HELEN: She's right. Ain't nobody strong enough. And even if there was -- who'd help us?
 
INT. SERENITY - DINING ROOM - MAL
in a wicked-cool CLOSE UP whips his gun at us with a stylish rack to the barrel. He's cleaning and checking it, looking casually heroic. Spread out on the dining room table are an assortment of his best guns and such.
INARA enters behind him. He doesn't hear her.
INARA: Hi.
MAL: BWAAA!
INARA: Sorry. I didn't mean to startle.
MAL: You didn't. I was just, uh... (repeating as if he meant to, points gun) BWAAA! That's more like a... It's a warrior like... It strikes fear into the...heart of (nothin') You know, not wise, sneaking up on a man when he's handling his weapon.
INARA: I'm sure I've heard that said. But perhaps the dining area isn't the place for this sort of thing?
MAL: What do you mean? Only place with a table big enough.
INARA: Of course. In that case... (rearranges guns) Every well-bred petty crook knows that the small concealable weapons always go to the far left of the place setting.
Mal bridles at the term "petty crook". Before he can speak, WASH enters from the bridge.
WASH: Got a distress call coming in. Some folks asking for help.
MAL: Really? Folks asking for help? From us petty crooks?
WASH: Well...
MAL: (at Inara) Maybe I should take that right away.
Mal makes to do that, but Wash stops him with:
WASH: Well, it's for her.
MAL: Hunh?
WASH: The call's for Inara.
INARA: I'll take it in my shuttle.
WASH: All right. I'll send it back there to you.
MAL: This distress wouldn't happen to be taking place in someone's pants, would it?
She throws a look, goes one way, Wash goes the other. Mal is left alone. A beat. As Mal whips his gun back up into a heroic frame,
MAL: (all cool) Bwaa.

 
EXT. SPACE
Serenity gently moving through the big black.
 
INT. INARA'S SHUTTLE - DAY
Inara sits at her cortex screen, where WE SEE the live image of NANDI.
NANDI: -- And I got word you were in the area... I'm imposing, but I got no one else to ask.
INARA: It sounds like something this crew can handle. I can't guarantee they'll handle it particularaly well, but --
NANDI: If they got guns, and brains at all...  
INARA: They've got guns...
NANDI: (worried) Payment won't be a problem. We just ain't equipped for this.
INARA: Nandi, it's gonna be all right.
NANDI: The House would tell you not to come. I know they ordered you to shun me when I left.
INARA: The House can <engage in a feces hurling contest with a monkey> [gun HOE-tze bee DIO-se]. I would have waved you long ago. It's just...
NANDI: Doesn't matter. (smiles) Who'd've thought we'd both end up all the way out here?
INARA: Who'd've thought.
NANDI: Let me know what your people say.
INARA: Of course.
NANDI: I'll wait to hear from you. (then) <Blessing on you, dear sister.> [TZOO-foo nee, mei-mei.]
INARA: And you.
Inara touches the screen. Nandi's image FREEZES there. Inara sits there quietly contemplative for a beat. Then:
INARA: I suppose you heard most of that? 
Mal appears, peaking around the corner at the entrance.
MAL: Only because I was eavesdropping. (then, no bullshit) Your friend sounds like she's in a peck of trouble.
INARA: She is. And there's no authority on that moon she can go to. They're totally alone.
MAL: Some men might take advantage of that.
INARA: One man.
MAL: And she's lookin' for someone to come along and explain things to him?
INARA: That's essentially it, yes.
MAL: A whole house full of companions... How they fixed for payment?
INARA: They're not companions. (then) They're whores.
MAL: Thought you didn't much care for that word?
INARA: It applies. They're not registered with the Guild. They're --
MAL: -- independent?
INARA: Yes. (then) If you agree to do this, you'll be compensated. I'll see to it. I've put a little aside...
MAL: You can keep your money. Won't be needing no payment.
INARA: Mal. Thank you. I'll contact Nandi at once. (he smiles; she turns away) But you will be paid. I feel it's important that we keep ours strictly a business arrangement.
Her back's to him now, so she doesn't see the stung look.
MAL: I'll speak with the crew.
INARA: Good.
She never looks back. Off Mal, waiting a beat before he goes --

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY
Mal has EVERYONE assembled (except Inara.) He's letting Zoe brief the troops. He's to the side, the silent commander.
ZOE: Those who have a mind are welcome to join. Those who just as soon stay on the ship can do that, too.
JAYNE: Hmm. Don't much see the benefit in getting involved in strangers' troubles without a upfront price negotiated.
BOOK: These people need assistance. The benefit wouldn't necessarily be for you.
JAYNE: S'what I'm sayin'
ZOE: No one's gonna force you to go, Jayne. As has been stated -- this job is strictly speculative.
JAYNE: Good. Don't know these folks. Don't much care to.
MAL: They're whores.
JAYNE: I'm in.
MAL: (moving off) Wash -- plot a course.
 
EXT. PLANET - DAY
Serenity lands amidst cover.
 
EXT. HEART OF GOLD - DAY
We see The Bordello, in all its tinfoil splendor.
Reverse on our people, in a long-lens tight group, heading towards it.
JAYNE: That's the whorehouse?
INARA: (you're an annoying idiot) Yes...
JAYNE: How come it looks like a frozen dinner pack?
KAYLEE: It's solar sheeting. Cheap power.
JAYNE: (genuine concern) Hope the whores are prettier'n thn the house...

INT BORDELLO LOBBY - DAY
Our gang files into the lobby. The girls are all hanging about, some making a bit of a show of themselves, draped about as if for customers, some more earnest or just curious. Inara is in the process of coming towards Nandi for a great big hug. Mal is behind her, waiting as is Zoe.
As for the rest, they politely nod and greet the whores, Kaylee guilelessley, Simon politely, Book kindly, Jayne grinningly, Wash uncomfortably, River inquisitively. Much adlibbing from them as have speaking parts. (Chari and Petaline are not present).
INARA: Nandi, darling.
NANDI: It's so good to see you, Mei Mei...
INARA: You look wonderful.
NANDI: And you look exactly the same as the day I left. How do you do that out here?
MAL: Sheer force of will.
INARA: Nandi, this is Malcolm Reynolds.
NANDI: I appreciate your coming.
She shakes his hand, firmlike.
MAL: Well, any friend of Inara's is a strictly businesslike relationship of mine.
The dig is not lost on Inara, nor is her reaction lost on Nandi
MAL: This is my first mate, Zoe. I'll introduce you to the rest later. They're good folk.
JAYNE: (calls out from across the room, no 'tude) Can I start getting sexed already?
MAL: Well, that one's kind of horrific
Jayne has Helen by the shoulder, is pointing at her... 
ZOE: (ugh) Can we talk business?
NANDI: (indicating lounge) In here. (to the others) The rest of you, there's food and some liquor at the sideboard, make yourselves to home.
The four exit. We stay with the others.
Kaylee looks at Simon and Wash, indicates the two young men.
KAYLEE: Look, they got boy whores! Isn't that thoughtful? Wonder if they service girlfolk at all.
WASH: Let's not ask.
SIMON: Isn't there a pregnant woman I'm to examine?
WASH: (to Kaylee) You'd really lie with someone being paid for it?
KAYLEE: (pointedly forlorn) Well, it's not like anyone else is lining up to, you know, examine me...
Kaylee glances at Simon.
JAYNE: (joining them) Whoop! My John Thomas is about to pop off and fly around the room, there's so much tasty in here. 
WASH: Would be you get your most poetical about your pecker.
Chari brings Petaline up to them.
CHARI: You'd be the Doctor?
SIMON: Yes. And this is Petaline?
PETALINE: Yes sir.
CHARI: She's feeling a mite weak right now.
SIMON: All right. Well, let's get you lying down.
JAYNE: Now that's a plan! Whoop!
He goes off with Helen, Simon goes to the back room with the two girls, River trailing.
We see Book making up a sandwich -- he is approached by LUCY and EMMA
EMMA: Shepherd --
BOOK: No thank you!
They smile a bit.
EMMA: We were hoping we might have a prayer meeting?
LUCY: We ain't had one in months, 'cept what Emma here reads out on Sunday
EMMA: Last Shepherd to come by was springtim, and he only read the one passage, and he took it out in trade off both of us.
Book has no response.
Kaylee watches the girls chat up Book...
KAYLEE: Everybody's got somebody... (wistfully) Wash, tell me I'm pretty...
WASH: Were I unwed, I would take you in a manly fashion
KAYLEE: 'Cause I'm pretty?
WASH: 'Cause you're pretty.

INT. LOUNGE - DAY
Mal, Zoe, Nandi and Inara. Mid talk.
MAL: I take it reason doesn't enter into this?
NANDI: Not with Rance Burgess. The man is a taker.
ZOE: You think the kid is his?
NANDI: (firm) I think it's Petaline's.
INARA: But the blood test...
NANDI: Well, he did favor Petaline pretty exclusively, but she had others. Fifty-fifty, not that it matters. The man ain't fit to raise a cactus plant. His barren prairie shrew can't bear him an heir, so he takes it into his head to pull it outta us. That's not gonna happen.
MAL: (likes her strength) I see that's the case.
NANDI: And you see the way we live here. Go into town, it's the same. Some places come up rustic 'cause they ain't got more'n the basics. Rance Burgess has money enough to build a city, a real community. He keeps people living like this so he can play cowboy, be the one with the best toys. Turned this moon into a gorram theme park. Someone stands up to him... He means to burn me out.
MAL: Yeah. He sounds like a fun guy. I'd like to meet him.
NANDI: This won't be solved with talk.
MAL: I'm gonna fight a man, it helps to size him up.
NANDI: Well, he'll be at the theatre tonight, that's a certainty.
MAL: Then so will I. Inara, think you can stoop to being on my arm?
INARA: Will you wash it first?
He smiles at the light dig, turns to Zoe.
 
INT. THEATER - NIGHT
A CIRCULAR SHADOW representing Earth-That-Was FILLS THE FRAME. Silhouetted shapes appear. SPACESHIPS. They radiate out from the shadow sphere. We're witnessing some form of Balinese puppet theater. A nattily attired NARRATOR (speaking in Chinese: see addendum) presides before the backlit gauze screen across which the shadows play. It's the story of the destruction and fleeing of Earth-That-Was.
WIDER - Well-heeled PATRONS mill about as the show continues on a small stage in the b.g. The theater itself is upscale, ornate in its own particular way. Asian and Pacific influences abound.
Mal and Inara enter, arm-in-arm. They're dressed to kill.
Burgess is lording it over a particularly influential crowd. He's holding court, his guests laughing with disturbing frequency and force. Near Rance sits his wife, BELINDA. Pale and slight, she's dressed a cut about most every woman there, fiscally speaking. Conservative excess.
Mal and Inara stroll up to where the conversation is in progress.
BURGESS: (midstream) ... so I told the boy: you take a clean woman's virtue, you take the woman. And that's for life. And...
MAN_IN_HAT: Boy said his vows right then and there.
BURGESS: Took very little persuading on my part.
Burgess pats his laser pistol which hangs conspicuously on his belt. LAUGHTER from the assembled. And now Mal is among them, laughing LOUDER and LONGER than any of them. Finally everyone's starting at him.
MAL: Nice to know there's some places left in the 'verse where old-fashioned values still mean a thing. (to Inara) Isn't that right, dear?
INARA: (forced smile) Mmmm.
BURGESS: I don't think I know you...
MAL: (hand extended) Name's Malcolm. Malcolm Reynolds.
Burgess takes Mal's hand. They shake. Mal doesn't let go as he leans in a bit closer, says:
MAL: And might I just say? She is quite a beauty
Mal releases Burgess's hand. Burgess looks at him.
BURGESS: Well, thank you.
He unholsters his laser gun, offers it up to Mal.
BURGESS: Ever have occasion to handle one, Mister Reynolds? (offering it) Silk trigger active return bolt laster
Mal takes the laser pistol, looks it over
MAL: It's lighter than it looks. Thought it'd have more heft to it.
BURGESS: Oh, no. Don't let that fool you. Won't find technology like that short of Alliance. And even their issues don't yet have the auto-target adjust. Had that one crafted special.
MAL: I didn't think weapons such as this were generally legal -- for a private owner, I mean.
BELINDA: My husband makes a distinction between legality and morality, Mister Reynolds.
Mal glances over at Belinda, holds her eyes for a beat.
MAL: I've said that myself.
BURGESS: Bending one unjust law is a small thing when it comes to protecting one's family.
MAL: I think I understand you.
BURGESS: (smiles) And as you say -- she is a beauty.
MAL: She sure is. (hands it back) Of course, I was referring to the lady. (nods to Belinda) Ma'am
Mal steers Inara away. The others watch them go. 
Now Burgess' FUTURE CELLPHONE BEEPS. He takes it out of his pocket, his eyes still on the retreating Mal --
BURGESS: Yes?
 
EXT. TOWN - NIGHT
Mal and Inara exit the theater hastily. Mal walks quickly, looking to put distance between himself and the theater.
INARA: Well?
MAL: Well what?
INARA: You said you wanted to look him in the eye. You've done that. So what's the plan?
MAL: Plan is -- we get back to Serenity and we get off this rock just as fast as we can.
Mal hasn't slowed his pace. Off Inara, surprised --
 
INT. THEATER - NIGHT
Burgess is in a private-ish corner speaking on his future cell phone. Belinda joins him, expectant.
BURGESS: (into cell) And there can be no mistake? Good.
Beat. Burgess snaps the cell shut. Mulls
BELINDA: Rance?
BURGESS: The DNA matches. The child is mine.

 
INT. BORDELLO LOBBY - NIGHT
Mal stands in the center of the bordello's lobby, his finery from the previous scene taken down a notch. The crew and the staff of the Heart of Gold surround him.
MAL: We run.
Nandi takes this with stoic calm. 
MAL: Math just don't add up. Our weapon store aren't exactly overpowerin' at the moment, and I don't much like what we'd be up against...
The Serenity crew looks a bit surprised by this as well.
MAL: Nothing worse than a monster who thinks he's right with God. We might turn Burgess away once, but he'll keep comin' -- won't stop 'till he gets what he thinks is his. So we run.
NANDI: I understand, Captain Reynolds. You have your people to think of, same as me. And this ain't your fight.
MAL: I don't believe you do understand, Nandi. I said "we run." (Nandi gives no response) We. My people. Your people. And whatever bits of precious you got in this house you can't bear to part with. We load up Serenity and we leave Burgess in the dust.
Nandi steps closer to Mal, all strength and resolve. Despite the audience of listeners, she and Mal talk with intimate intensity, as if they're the only ones there.
NANDI: Captain Reynolds... It took me years to cut this piece of territory out of other men's hands. To build this business up from nothing.
MAL: Nandi--
NANDI: It's who I am. And it's my home. I'm not going anywhere.
MAL: He'll kill you. (re: her people) Kill every last one of them, it comes to that. And he'll sleep well that night.
NANDI: Rance Burgess is just a man... And I won't let any man take what's mine. I doubt you'd do different, in my position.
Eyes still locked on each other, a stalemate of personal cool, until Mal shakes his head slightly.
MAL: Well, lady I must say-- (admiring smile) You're my kinda stupid.
JAYNE: Ah, hell, he ain't expectin' much of a fight. Might be we catch him with his drawers low.
Mal raises his eyebrows. Zoe checks the chamber of her gun, cocks it.
ZOE: (nods) He'll probably ride in by daylight, but I figure a three point watch, say, four hour shift, just be on the safe side.
WASH: (nods, mock expertise) Three-point, four-hour, should do it.
Mal gives a slight smile, then Book steps up.
BOOK: I'm fair handy with a hammer, Captain.
MAL: That so, Shepherd--?
BOOK: Been following the footsteps of a carpenter for some time now. I think I can do something about our fortifications.
Mal looks over the rest of his people, Kaylee smiles and nods, Simon looks up. We feel Mal take understated pride in knowing them.
MAL: OK then...
His strategy wheels start turning, as UNDERSTATED 'GET sHIT DONE' MUSIC starts to build.
MAL: We start shootin', they'll most like try to burn us out, save sweat and bullets. Nandi, What's the water supply like here?
NANDI: Underground well. Pump that draws it up's antiquated, but it don't break down.
MAL: Kaylee-- think you can swing an upgrade for their waterworks?
KAYLEE: I'll talk to Serenity, see what she's got we might use.
MAL: Good. Might want to scrounge up-- 
River is suddenly at their side
RIVER: It's starting.
Kaylee gives a little STARTLED JUMP, unseen by Mal.
MAL: And that it is. But time is on the enemy's side so we've got to--
PETALINE: (pained yelp) Dr. Tam--!
Mal sees Petaline, who Simon helps to her feet as she pants with contraction.
MAL: Oh. It's starting. Okay. Okay. (a little panicky) It's starting! All right. Now. Yeah. Uh. Everybody relax. Be calm. Nobody panic. Everybody... It's going to be okay. (to Simon) Be all right?
Simon leads Petaline toward the bordello's back room, nodding to Mal.
SIMON: I got this one, Captain
MAL: Thanks. Okay.
Mal looks around at everyone else, who smile, at the brink of chuckling, at his display. He CLAPS his hands, resuming his heroical authority.
MAL: Okay then. Let's get to work, people!

INT./EXT. HEART OF GOLD - DAY
Various angles:
Book nailing planks.
Planks being put on windows.
Jayne checking weapons.
Wash and Zoe testing booby trap.
Feet burying rope in the sand (for booby trap).
Inara passing Nandi with steaming towels.
In labor, Petaline screams.
Jayne and Zoe prepare their weapons.
 
INT.BORDELLO LABBY - BALCONY - DAY
Book wields a hammer, boarding up windows. Lucy and Emma, the "church" whores, assist.
EMMA: The girls and I've been talkin', Shepherd.
He stops, turns to face her.  
EMMA: We've been discussin' what we'd like said over us if we should happen to fall --
BOOK: No.
Book reaches out, places a hand on her.
BOOK: I only bury the dead, child. No one here is going to die.
He smiles and the tension disappears.

INT. BORDELLO - UPSTAIRS ROOM - DAY
JAYNE: There's people gonna die.
Jayne sits in front of a large window, its field of view panoramic. Across from him, Helen sits attentively.
JAYNE: And with people dyin' comes guts and screamin' That can bring on all sorts of screwed-up behavior, a person ain't used to it. When the time comes, most important thing, keep your wits about you. Clear?
Helen nods. Jayne reaches over to a nearby table strewn with weapons and ammunition.
JAYNE: All right. Now, these are my favorites. You're to keep 'em comin' till there ain't no more to be had. I shoot, I run out you hand me the next biggest and so on. There an understanding here?
HELEN: Yes.
JAYNE: All righty, then. Lets get to work. 
Giggling, Helen hops on top of Jayne, straddles him. She plants wet kisses all over. Jayne craning his neck to keep his mouth out of reach.
 
EXT. BORDELLO - DAY
Wash seeps a pile of dry earth over a wood-and-rope contraption, securing and camouflaging the device.
 
WASH: All I'm saying is that we're living pretty deep in the rough and tumble, and I don't see that changing any time soon.
Zoe rises up behind him, a large spool of wire in her hands.
ZOE: Nor do I.
She crouches, begins to wind the wire between one of two stakes buried deep in the ground, some fifteen feet apart.
WASH: Well, I'm not sure now is the best time to bring a tiny little helpless person into our lives.
Wash lies flat, secures the wire to the stake. He takes a pair of
WIRECUTTERS and cuts the wire.
ZOE: That excuse is getting a little worn, honey.
WASH: It's not an excuse, dear. It's objective assessment. I can't help that it stays relevant.
Zoe stands, starts kicking dirt over the lines of their trap.
ZOE: I don't give a good gorram about relevant, Wash. Or objective. And I ain't so afraid of losing something that I ain't gonna try to have it. You and I would make one beautiful baby. And I want to meet that child one day. Period.
Zoe walks away as Wash looks after her.
 
INT. NANDI'S ROOM - EVENING
Mal looks out the window. We can't see what he sees, but we hear a cluster of gunshots, followed by the barking of Jayne:
JAYNE: (O.S.) Nothin'! Y'all are pulling, not squeezing like I said. Next one don't hit that board is giving up a special treat, <you understand?> [dong MA?]
Mal closes the window, smiling a little.
MAL: That man's gonna use up all our credit 'fore we've earned it.
NANDI: Well, after you've saved our lives you can do some chores, maybe.
She is getting a box from her bottom drawer. As they talk she layes it on the bed, pulls out a few fancy looking pistols.
MAL: I'm a fair hand with a mop.
NANDI: So your legend tells. (chuckling) Truth is, I expected a whole lot more of you to be taking payment in our trade.
MAL: Well, we're an odd conglomeration. Got a preacher, a married fellah, and the doctor... well, he'd have to relax for thirty seconds to get his play. That'd be more or less a miracle. (re: guns) These are fetching little pieces. Any of them work?
NANDI: Don't got many rounds for the Chaplain there, but the rest'll be of use. (picks one up) This is my favorite.
MAL: What's its history?
NANDI: Violence and crime, sad to say. What about you?
MAL: Similar.
NANDI: No, I mean, when are you planning to avail yourself of some of our trade? My girls is clean and kind-spirited.
MAL: Well, I got the job on my mind. After, I'm sure I'll... trade. They're a fine bunch.
NANDI: You ain't looked at one of 'em as long or as lovin' as you looked at those pistols. You're not sly, are you? 'cause I got my boys...
MAL: (totally comfortable with the question) Sly? No. I lean towards womenfolk. Just one thing at a time. Never like complications.
She smiles, knowingly.
NANDI: Well, I'm certain of that.
MAL: Something to be smiling at?
NANDI: I trained as a companion, remember? I read people pretty well.
MAL: Well, that's nice for you.
He's examining the weapons, deliberately.
NANDI: She's a hell of a woman, ain't she? (off his look) Inara.
MAL: (casual) Yeah. She's a cherry blossom, no denyin'. (still looking at gun) 'spect you know her better'n I do, comin' up together and all.
NANDI: Imagine I do. She ever tell you why she left Sihnon?
MAL: Never asked.
NANDI: Yes you did, and I don't know my own self. I was gone long before. And I'll tell you, it was a shock, her leaving. She was special. There's forty women in House Madrassa and you'd pick her out in a second. Coulda been House Priestess, few years time.
MAL: Is that right?
NANDI: Had her eyes on it, too. Very focused. She's like you, more than a little.
MAL: And how exactly is that?
NANDI: She hates complications.
A moment between them. A small understanding.
MAL: They do crop up though, don't they?
NANDI: Such is life.
 
BACK ROOM - NIGHT
Petaline is in bed, letting out an impressive YELL. She's sweaty and breathing hard. Inara is by her side, mopping her brow supportively.
Simon is at the foot of the bed, looking under the tent of sheet they've rigged up. River looks over his shoulder, completely agape.
SIMON: You're not completely dilated yet. It should be pretty quick but don't try to force it. The contractions are still preliminary.
PETALINE: What's he saying?
INARA: It's gonna be a little while, sweetie.
PETALINE: Oh! But it hurts! This child wants to be born, I know it.
SIMON: (to Inara) Can you get the green vial from my bag? We can dull the pain some.
Inara crosses, pausing by Simon, whispers --
INARA: How many babies have you actually delivered?
SIMON: As the primary? This would be the first. You?
INARA: My first too.
RIVER: (looking even closer) Mine too.
They look at River a moment.
SIMON: It's gonna be a long night.
Inara gives him a peck on the cheek for luck.
INARA: You'll do great, Doctor.
RIVER: (still staring) Who do you think is in there...?
Petaline huffs and puffs...

INT. NANDI'S ROOM - NIGHT
It's very late, and Mal and Nandi are on the couch. He throws back a shot. They've both been drinking for a while.
NANDI: It was the dulcimer
MAL: The Dulcimer drove you out of Sihnon. What, did you kill a dulcimer in a terrible passion?
NANDI: (smiles) Actually, yes.
MAL: Ah! And now that Dulcimer's family's out to get even. I get it.
NANDI: I was at practice. You never stop practicing, you know, not a true companion. Some baroque place, and instructor keeps saying "You're playing it, not feeling it". And the fifth time he said it I took the damn thing and smashed it into kindling.
Mal laughs appreciatively.
NANDI: And that's when it occurred to me that a companion's life might just be a little too constricting. 
She pours two more shots.
NANDI: So I trucked out to the border, learned to say "ain't," came to find work. Found this place. 
MAL: It's a nice place.
NANDI: It was a dungheap. Run by a pig who had half the girls strung out on drops. There's no Guild out here; they let men run the houses, and they don't ask for references. We didn't get along.
MAL: And where's he at now?
NANDI: Let's just say he ain't playing the dulcimer anymore either.
They clink glasses. Knock 'em back.
MAL: You are a remarkable woman, you don't mind my saying.
NANDI: Well. as long as it's you saying it, and not my fine rice wine.
MAL: Well, it takes more'n a few drinks to render my judgement blurry. What about you? Am I getting any prettier?
NANDI: By the minute.
She is so sweetly seductive that they hold on each other a moment. Then he breaks it, all conscience.
MAL: (rising) I should check the barricades, make sure everyone's ready to --
NANDI: Everyone's asleep. Well, them as can, night before a fight.
She stares into Mal's eyes.
NANDI: Can you?
MAL: What?
NANDI: Sleep?
Another beat, as that loaded question settles in. Mal's reply is intimate in tone, as well.
MAL: Miss Nandi, I have a confession to make.
NANDI: Maybe I should get the Shepherd.
MAL: Well, I ain't sinned yet, and I'd feel little more than awkward if he were here when I did.
NANDI: You expect to accomplish something sinful then, do you?
MAL: If I'm overstepping my bounds, you let me know.
NANDI: <Extraordinarily impatient Buddha> [jen mei NAI-shing duh FWO-tzoo], Malcolm, I been waiting for you to kiss me since I showed you my guns --
They're kissing. It's soft, but not without heat. He pulls away, looks at her.
NANDI: You okay with this?
MAL: I'm just waiting to see if I pass out. Long story.
NANDI: I want you to bed me.
MAL: I guess I mean to.
NANDI: I ain't her.
MAL: Only people in this room are you and me.
NANDI: So, my child... How long has it been since your last confession?
MAL: Longer than I care to say.
NANDI: You gonna remember where everything goes?
MAL: Let's just say I plan to take it real slow.
They kiss.
 
INT. NANDI'S ROOM - NIGHT
It is later, and they are still in the act. They are both naked, him sitting up at the foot of the bed and her astraddle, sheets pooled about their lower portions of them and clever camera work concealing the more interesting details of the upper. Their movement is slow, deliberate -- and not quite so rhythmic as to be entirely specific. They are drenched 
in sweat. 
He runs his hands along the side of her head, his thumb sliding indelicately into the corner of her mounth, Nandi biting down lightly, eyes closing, then opening again, near tartled as his hands slip to her hips and they look at each other with something resembling need.
She brings his head to her breast, still moving, eyes wet with tears not spilt.

EXT. TOWN - NIGHT
BURGESS: So the whore's got herself a champion, has she?
He is standing in the light of a couple of torches, on the balcony of a two story building, couple of his men behind him. He looks over the railing a moment, amused. Looks back to the person he's addressing.
BURGESS: This great man got a name?
REVERSE to see CHARI is the one feeding him info. Why, she's a TURNCOAT!
CHARI: Reynolds. Malcolm Reynolds.
BURGESS: (thoughtfully) Mmm. Yes, I've met the man. How many does he got with him?
CHARI: Just a few, and only two real fighters besides hisself. But they got the girls stirrin' for a battle
BURGESS: I certainly wasn't expecting a battle.
He chuckles, turns out over the railing, addressing his men.
BURGESS: Seems the Heart of Gold has got itself a few mercenaries. Guess we'd best call the whole thing off! 
As he say this, the camera pans over to take in the view of the men -- and they number at least thirty, many on horseback, and total bad-asses.
A ROAR of laughter meets Burgess' statment.
Burgess grins, turns back to Chari.
BURGESS: Earned yourself quite a bag of silver, little kitten. But I got a few more chores in mind before you get it, though.
CHARI: I'm ready.
He motions for her to come closer, puts his arm around her as he addresses the men.
BURGESS: Now Chari here, she understands a whore's place, don't she?
General assent and applause.
BURGESS: But Nandi, and those others, they spit on our town. They've no respect fo the sanctity of fatherhood, for decency or family. They have MY CHILD held hostage to their decedent ways, and that I will not abide!
More cheers.
BURGESS: We will show them what power is! We will show them what their position in this town is! Let us all remember, right here and now, what a woman is to a man!
He turns to Chari, no longer smiling.
BURGESS: Get on your knees.
She looks startled. Looks out at all the men watching. But Burgess is unwavering, and she hesitantly sinks out of the frame.
ANGLE: THE MEN
There is a pause. Then an uproarious cheer.
 
 
EXT. BORDELLO - DAWN
The sun creeps over the horizon. The MORNING OF.

INT. NANDI'S ROOM - DAWN
Mal and Nandi are asleep together, in a tangle of sheets, in a tangle of limbs. Content.
Sunlight streams in from the horizon, cutting her across the eyes. They blink awake. she looks at him sleeping awhile.

INT. BORDELLO LOBBY - MORNING
Mal is coming quietly out of Nandi's room, doing up his shirt, just as Inara is coming from the back hall. He stops, totally busted.
MAL: Um...
INARA: Well.
She is startled, but doesn't seem shocked. That doesn't stop Mal from excusifying.
MAL: I...I just had to tell Nandi about, um, about time to... (shifts topic) Big fight today!
INARA: Mal. Please.
MAL: No, I, no, I, well, I, uh...
INARA: (sincerely) So you took to bed with Nandi. I'm glad.
MAL: You know, I was up... I got to thinkin' and ponderin'... Glad?
INARA: Yes! She's a dear friend, and probably in need of some comfort about now.
MAL: Well, uh...
INARA: (amused) One of the virtues of not being puritanical about sex is not feeling embarressed afterwards. You should look into it.
MAL: Well, I just, I... didn't want you thinking that I was taking advantage of your friend.
INARA: She's well worth taking advantage of, I sincerely hope you did.
MAL: So you're okay. Well, yeah. Why, why wouldn't you be?
INARA: I wouldn't say I'm entirely okay. I'm a little appalled at her taste.
Smiling, she turns and exits, leaving him come-backless.
 
INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM - MORNING
The sun's a mite higher now. Jayne stirs, stretches, as does Helen. Jayne pulls a gun free from between them. They spoon then go back to sleep.
 
INT. BACK ROOM - MORNING
We see Petaline, having dozed off. Track across the room to find Inara sitting on the floor in the corner. Sobbing her eyes out.
 
EXT. PLAINS - MORNING
Wash and Kaylee trek towards Serenity. Wash sips his coffee from a lidded MUG. He has a PISTOL holstered at his side.
Mal's voice comes in over Wash's RADIO HANDSET.
MAL: (O.S.) Wash -- you there yet?
Wash pulls his radio off his belt and answers.
WASH: All but. Nice day for a last stand, innit?
MAL: Nope. Plan to make a healthy few stands after this one. Just hopin' for some air support from your quarter, is all.
WASH: (nods) Couple of low fly-overs, engines tipped earthward at full blast, should give our guests something other than killin' you to think about.
MAL: (O.S.) What I like to hear... Out.
Wash clicks off his radio and clips it back to his belt.
KAYLEE: Captain seem a little funny to you at breakfast this morning?
WASH: Oh, Kaylee. We all know I'm the funny one.
 
INT. BORDELLO - MORNING
Mal walks behind some of the women, who stand in position at the bottom floor lobby windows, holding rifles. He himself is now armed for battle.
He wears a RADIO EARWIG.
MAL: You ladies and gentlemen all locked and loaded?
VARIOUS_PEOPLE: Locked and loaded. Got it. Yes, sir.
MAL: Good. Remember, shoot the man, not the horse. Dead horse is cover, live horse, great pile of panic.
He stops as a TRANSMISSION crackles in over his earwing.
JAYNE: (O.S.) (lewd chuckle) Whoa now, girl, that is just plain dirty --
He holds a finger up to his ear and hits the transmit switch.
MAL: Jayne -- You are aware your radio's transmittin'?
 
INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM - MORNING
CLOSE ON RADIO HEADSET - which sits in a twist of bedspread. Jayne's hand enters frame, fumbling for it.
MAL: (O.S) Cause I don't feel particularly girlish or dirty at the moment.
Jayne picks up the radio and speaks into it as he untangles himself from Helen. He's dressed for war. She, not so much.
JAYNE: Oh, ah, yeah, just up here waitin' Captain. Ready one-hunnert-percent.
He grabs his weapon and looks out his window.
MAL: (O.S.) Better be.
Jayne gives Helen a sharp businesslike nod, and she nods back.
 
INT. BACK ROOM - MORNING
CLOSE ON Petaline, who writhes in the throes of a contraction.
PETALINE: (continued scream)
Her legs are up and spread apart, concealed by a sheet. Inara holds her hand.
Inara leans in towards Petaline's face.
INARA: You're stonger than this thing, honey. I can feel it in your grip... (Petaline SCREAMS again) Petaline, look at me--
Petaline looks up at Inara, who catches her eyes in an intense, almost hypnotic stare.
INARA: This is just a moment in time... Step aside and let it happen...
As River watches intently, Petaline nods.
Nandi enters, stopping at Inara's side.
NANDI: How is she, Doctor?
Simon speaks from a counter a short distance away, as he fits a VIAL OF MED into his HYPO-GUN.
SIMON: She's at ten centimeters. Not long now.
Nandi turns to Inara. They share a subtle exchange of looks. This should be cut to show they're communicating via expression alone -- Companions wordlessly reading each other.
Nandi smiles sadly, rest a hand on Inara's shoulder.
NANDI: (O.S) Inara... I thought it was just him...
Inara turns to Petaline. Then quietly:
INARA: Nandi, believe me. I'll be fine.
They share a look and Nandi exits.
Simon comes to the bedside and injects something into Petaline's arm.
 
INT. HEART OF GOLD - A BIT LATER
Nandi comes to where Mal is. They get rifles ready over:
MAL: Morning. How'er you doing?
NANDI: Mite tense.
MAL: (indicating upstairs) I'd like you best on the balcony with me. We can see everyone from up there, and if anything goes...
NANDI: You didn't give me the whole truth, Mal.
MAL: 'bout what?
NANDI: 'Bout her feelings for you.
MAL: I really don't know --
JAYNE: (on cam) Mal! Looks like we got some imminent violence!

EXT. PLAINS - ELSEWHERE - MORNING
A beat of quiet. Then the FAR-OFF SOUND of horses as a cloud of dust rises on the horizon. SMASH CUT TO --
-- MID-THUNDER with the MERCENARY HORSEMEN surging forward at full gallop, flanking Burgess' hovercraft.
Burgess pilots the hovercraft, expressionless, behind stylish mirrored goggles. Over his face, PRE-LAP Petaline's SCREAM OF PAIN --

EXT. BORDELLO - MORNING
Burgess and his riders, charging forward in the distance, trailing a plume of dust.

INT. BORDELLO LOBBY - MORNING
Mal, now standing on the interior balcony, looks through a slim pair of BINOCULARS.
We see many men and guns approaching. Rance drives his hovercraft. A machine gun is mounted on its rear with a man ready to fire.
Mal, now standing on the interior balcony, lowers a slim pair of BINOCULARS. He is not at all pleased.
Rance and his men approach even closer, ready for action.
MAL: Zoe, Jayne -- you seein' this?
JAYNE: (O.S.) Gotta be thirty men out there.
ZOE: (O.S.) Confirm that. Plus a mounted gun on that hovercraft.
JAYNE: (O.S) What's that you said about runnin' for it?
Mal takes a moment, visibly adjusting to the new odds. He lifts up his RIFLE.
MAL: Okay, folks. We got no shortage of ugly ridin' in on us. But that don't change the plan.
Nandi climbs the stairs, gun in hand, addressing the whores.
NANDI: Anybody here goes down, you drag 'em to the back, then get back to shooting. Only way to help them is to finish this.
She cocks her rifle then turns to Mal, smiles at him sweetly for a quick beat.
Mal smiles back.
 
INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - DAY
Kaylee and Wash enter through the SMALL DOOR. Kaylee closes the door behind them; something's not right-- She scans the bay as they start for the stairs. Mal CRACKLES IN over Wash's radio:
MAL: (O.S.) Wash -- gonna be tradin' injuries in under two minutes. Like my sky a little less empty --
WASH: Copy that, Mal. We--
Kaylee sees SHADOWY FIGURES on the catwalk above, and tackles Wash just as GUNFIRE rains down at them, SPARKING off the metal.
Wash slams down behind some metal crates, Kaylee on top of him. The radio skitters off into open floor; unreachable. But they have cover for the moment. Wash looks up into her face.

EXT. BORDELLO - DAY
The hovercraft HUMS forward, just ahead of the horsemen.
Lead horse SNAPS A TRIPWIRE, and the ROPE springs up out of the dirt, singing taut, catching THREE RIDERS in teh throats and pitching them off their horses. The other riders duck, some slide sideways in thier saddles, clearing the line.
Burgess calls back to KOZICK, the man on the crafts large MOUNTED GUN.
BURGESS: Open her up, Kozick--
Kozick nods, cranks back a lever and starts shooting -- MASSIVE MACHINE GUNFIRE flares.
 
INT. BORDELLO LOBBY - CONTINUING
Mal sees it coming and swings behind his shielding.
MAL: Cover!
The women do the same, just as a HAIL OF MACHINE GUNFIRE rips through everything that isn't fortified.
MAL: (into earwig) Jayne -- I do believe that's our first hurdle. You might --

EXT. BORDELLO - CONTINUING
Kozick, FIRING AWAY, is plugged in the chest and FLIPS BACKWARD off the hovercraft.

INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM - CONTINUING
Jayne pulls his eye away from his sight long enough to speak into his radio:
JAYNE: Think I might, Cap'n.
 
INT. BORDELLO LOBBY - CONTINUING
Mal calls to his troops.
MAL: Fire!
They all swing out and unleash a BARRAGE OF FIRE from their positions. General mayhem, inside and out. A BOY WHORE falls away from a window down the line, bloodied by a gunshot. Mal RETURNS FIRE.
In the confusion, Chari crawls out of the room. Another whore is shot.
Nandi sees this and bristles, aiming another shot --
NANDI: <dirty bastard sons-of--> [Wang bao DAHN--]
She FIRES.
 
EXT. BORDELLO - CONTINUING
A HORSEMAN takes it in the neck and flops off his horse.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - DAY
Wash and Kaylee under fire. Wash is trading shots with his pistol, as THREE OF BURGESS' MEN work their way along the upper catwalk. Wash and Kaylee fall back behind different crates, finally getting close to the door that leads to the COMMON AREA.
WASH: GO!
Kaylee darts out, Wash behind her, fire a FLURRY OF SHOTS to cover their exit.
They get through the door.
The men race down the stairs after them. CAMERA FINDS the radio
MAL: (O.S.) Wash -- Where the hell is my spaceship!?

EXT. BORDELLO - CONTINUING
Horsemen criss-crossing, SEVERAL get hit by GUNFIRE from the whorehouse, dropping them from their steeds.
A HORSE GOES DOWN, crashing into the FG and throwing its rider.
The REST RETURN FIRE.
Burgess angles the hovercraft, flying parallel with the house front, still a ways off. He lifts his laser and FIRES a CONTINUOUS BEAM.
The BEAM sears along the front of the house, wavering between the second story windows and the eaves of the roof, which already started SMOKING.
 
INT BORDELLO LOBBY - CONTINUING
As the LASER BEAM races a RED-HOT LINE along their barricade, FLASHING through the gun-slits as Mal and the others hunker away.
Mal looks up, where he sees SMOKE pouring in from a TORN UP PATCH OF CEILING.
MAL: Ruttin' lasers -- (into earwig) Book -- Zoe -- Second hurdle --

EXT. BORDELLO - CONTINUING
FIRE HAS BROKEN OUT on the front facade of the whorehouse.
Book holds a hose.
Zoe covers his back with her rifle. He starts up the hose, and a HISSING JET OF WATER sprays up toward the wall.
A HORSEMAN turns toward them, levelling his gun at Book. Zoe FIRES, taking him out.

INT. BORDELLO LOBBY - CONTINUING
Mal, Nandi, and the others continue BLASTING AWAY. Petaline's SCREAMING comes in from the back room.

INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUING
Simon is in position, Petaline is bearing down hard and SCREAMING between breaths. River is fascinated and smiling. Inara holds Petaline in support.
PETALINE: [screams again]
SIMON: That's it, Petaline, one more push--
She bears down.
SIMON: That's the shoulders... Good--

EXT. BORDELLO - CONTINUING
The horsemen are in chaos now, riderless and wounded horses stymie their efforts to fire on the house. Our guys are kicking ass!
Book catches sight of PAIR OF RIDERS behind Zoe, taking aim. He swings the hose around, BLASTING them off their horses with its powerful stream. Zoe shoots one of the men

INT. BORDELLO LOBBY - CONTINUING
Up on the balcony, Mal talks into his earwig as he scans the battlefield.
MAL: Jayne -- I lost visual on Burgess --
JAYNE: (O.S.) Same here --

INT. SIDE OF HOUSE - CONTINUING
Burgess' hovercraft is up close to the house, and he's leaping off of it to the ground. A BULKHEAD CELLAR DOOR swings open. Chari is there, and ushers Burgess inside.

INT. SERENITY - DINING AREA - CONTINUING
The three Mercenaries move through the dining area, grimfaced, covering it with their guns, cursorily checking its nooks and crannies for their prey.
MERCENARY_1: (pointing) Take the right.
A DOOR LOCKING SHUT calls their attention to the aft corridor.
They see Wash at its end and raise their guns.
WASH: [that weird Robert Mitchum 'hoot!' from Night of the Hunter]
MERCENARY_1: Hey! There he is. Get him!
Wash darts into the engine room, narrowly missed by their FIRE as they move into the AFT CORRIDOR.
Kaylee pops out of CLEVER HIDING PLACE and swings the door shut behind them, then locks it.

INT. SERENITY - AFT CORRIDOR - CONTINUING
Before they can react, Wash swings the ENGINE ROOM DOOR shut as well, locking it. The passage leading off from the middle of the corridor is BARRED BY ITS DOOR. They're trapped.

INT. SERENITY - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUING
Wash peers in through the thick glass porthole, issuing adrenaline-charged laughter.
WASH: Ah-ha-ha-ha! Got you, you <piss-soaked pikers> [niao SE duh DOO-gway] (laughs again, then realizes he's trapped in engine room) Nobody's going...anywhere...

INT. BACK ROOM - DAY
Simon lifts up a SWADDLED BABY, purple, newborn, squealing. Inara and River look on. Petaline is near delierious from childbirth.
SIMON: It's --
RIVER: It's a boy. Healthy.
A DOOR behind Inara opens, and Burgess is there, laser covering them.
BURGESS: (points his gun) Good mornin', Petaline...

 
INT. BORDELLO - LOBBY - CONTINUING
Nandi hears PETALINE'S SCREAM first:
PETALINE: Rance! NO!
Mal is caught in the ebbing FIREFIGHT, but Nandi races down the stairs, toward the rear hall.

INT. BORDELLO - REAR HALL - CONTINUING
Burgess backs out of back room, where Petaline screams. He's got the BABY in one arm, laser pistol in the other. Nandi appears behind him, entering from the lobby, confronts him.
NANDI: Rance. Most of your men are either dead, dyin', or run off.
BURGESS: (aims his laser at Nandi) Oh, that don't matter none. i got what I came here for.
NANDI: Ain't leaving here with it.
BURGESS: This is my blood, woman.
Burgess gestures towards the baby with his pistol.
Suddenly a slim arm snakes a nasty curved RAZOR in under Burgess' chin from behind, digging its tip into the side of his throat, DRAWING BLOOD. It's Inara, accompanied by two ND whores, as cold dead serious as we've seen her.
INARA: (re: blood dripping down his neck) No. This is your blood. (nods to a whore) Now you hand that child over nice and slow, or I'll spill more than you can spare.
Burgess complies, wincing at the wound, handing the baby over to a whore, who backs out of the scene to safety.
As this happens, Burgess takes the pause to ELBOW Inara hard in the stomach. As she staggers back, he FIRES his laser from the hip, searing straight through Nandi's chest. He escapes out a side door.
Mal gets to the lobby end of the hall and moves to the fallen Nandi.
Mal touches Nandi. She's stone dead. He shares a look with Inara, there's murder in both their eyes. He hears the OS THRUM of the hovercraft starting up and turns for the front door.
 
EXT. BORDELLO - CONTINUOUS
ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR
The front door slams open and Mal stalks out, eyes forward.
Without dropping a beat, Mal PLUGS a horseman off his horse, and swings up into the saddle just as the man finishes falling.
Burgess' hovercraft rumbles out from behind the house, heading out for the plains.
Mal spurs the horse hard, and it tears off --
MAL: Hyah!

EXT. OPEN LAND - DAY
A WIDE LANDSCAPE SHOT of Burgess speeding away in his hovercraft and Mal in pursuit, his horse kicking up dust as he whips and spurs it into a breakneck gallop.  
Burgess sees Mal behind him and stands in his craft, steering with one hand as he turns back. He FIRES his laser--
The LASER BEAM cuts the air by Mal's head. Mal whips a burst of speed out of his horse as another BEAM sears past him.
Mal is closing in on the hovercraft, an easy shot. Burgess takes careful aim, and pulls his trigger. We hear a RAPID BEEPING. Burgess checks the display screen on his gun--
LASER GUN
The LCD screen flashes "CHECK BATTERY"
Burgess GROWLS, looking up just as Mal flies from his horse tackling Burgess off the hovercraft.
They slam into a hard roll on the plain.
Burgess has had the wind smashed out of him and writhes on the ground.
Mal ain't much better, but drags himself to his feet using sheer force of will.
He grabs Burgess' shirtfront and hauls him up, pulling his pistol from his holster, bringing its barrel up to Burgess' head.
MAL: You're gonna pay for what you've took.
BURGESS: (still out of breath) She was just a whore.
Mal seethes with vengeful fury, he's about to pull the trigger, but then -- he flips the gun in his hand and smashes the butt across Burgess' face. Burgess collapses, unconscious.
 
EXT. BORDELLO - DAY
Mal and Inara push Rance to the ground and tie the kneeling Burgess' hands behind his back.
TWO MEN CRASH INTO THE FRAME, as Jayne dumps the bruised and bloodied Serenity-crashers before the bordello steps.
Burgess' other men are also tied up.
BURGESS: (calling out) PETALINE! YOU BRING MY BABY OUT! RIGHT NOW! YOU HEAR ME? I WANT TO SEE MY SON!
Petaline appears at the bordello door, the baby held at her shoulder. All eyes watch as she descends the steps and approaches Burgess.
PETALINE: Rance, this is Jonah. (beat) Jonah, say hi to your daddy.
Burgess smiles like a proud papa. He's actually moved at the sight of his son.
Petaline raises her free hand in which she holds Nandi's favorite gun.
She aims it at Burgess' head. She fires. Rance drops face down to the ground.
PETALINE: Say goodbye to your daddy, Jonah.
Petaline looks up from Burgess' dead body, icy.
PETALINE: Go on. Go on home.
Petaline points her gun at Chari.
PETALINE: You go with them.
Chari breaks eye contact, falls in step with Burgess' men as they walk away.
Mal looks down.
LUCY: (V.O) Amazing Grace, how seet the sound...
 
EXT. HILLTOP - DAY
LONG SHOT: A score of mourners have gathered around a makeshift cross beneath a large oak. This is a fusion of BUDDIST and CHRISTIAN ceremony. A number of mourners are dressed in white robes, with Tibetan prayer beads draped over their clasped hands.
Lucy sings in a simple, quiet voice. (Think Margo Timmins.)
LUCY: That saved a wretch like me/ I once was lost, but now am found/ Was blind but now I see...
Lucy continues to sing. One by one, Nandi's staff steps up to the wooden cross marking her grave. At its foot is a low asian-looking table, on which sits a bowl of smoking incense. They bow as they drop pinches of incense into the bowl. The crew of Serenity looks on, each sad, each lost in his or her own thoughts.
Lucy's singing continues as we --
CUT TO:
Serenity lifts off into a gorgeous, golden sunset.
 
INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - NIGHT
Mal and Inara stand on the catwalk outside her shuttle. They are contemplative, subdued.
MAL: Think those girls'll do all right.
INARA: She taught them well.
MAL: Yeah.
A beat.
INARA: I'm, um... I'm glad you were with her. Her last night. I am.
MAL: Yeah, well. I ain't. Hell, I wish I'd never met her. Then I wouldn't've failed her.
INARA: That wasn't the way of it.
MAL: It's a kindness, but nothing you say'll convince me different.
INARA: Well, I'm still glad.
A small beat.
MAL: So you weren't before?
He's looking at her direct. She looks away.
MAL: Inara, I ain't looking for anything from you. I'm just, uh, just feeling kind of truthsome right now. But, uh... Life is too damn short for ifs and maybes.
INARA: I learned something from Nandi. Not just from what happened, but from her. The family she made, the strength of her love for them. That's what kept them together. When you live with that kind of strength, you get tied to it, you can't break away. And you never want to.
They're getting closer to each other, Mal's eyes locked on hers.
INARA: There's something... There's something I should have done a long while ago. And I'm sorry -- for both of us -- that it took me this long.
A beat.
INARA: I'm leaving.
Another moment, and she goes past him into her Shuttle.
He doesn't move.

 
EXT. SPACE BAZAAR - DAY
(Black, space-y day.) Ships land and take off from this decrepit but inviting old structure, clearly clapped together from several different ships and stations. We hold on it, silent but for a bit of intro music and a sudden, booming voice:
BARKER: (O.S.) We are not alone!

INT. BAZAAR - CONTINUING
It's a giant flea market/ food court/ carnival/ bar/ post office/ whatever the hell anybody needs out here station. We see the scope of the place as we push in (low angle) towards a BARKER, standing in front of a small, curtained off space. He's talking from the top, very fast, selling hard.
(NOTE: This is not a large build -- it's the size of a large closet, curtained off on all sides, with but one display.)
BARKER: Forget what you think you know. Forget what your mother told you when she tucked you in at night, forget the lies of our oppressive, cabalistic Allied governments! Behind this curtain is the very secret they do not want you to see -- the most astounding scientific find in the history of humanity. Proof! Of Alien life. That's right, go ahead and laugh, sir, but what you see inside this room will change your life forever! It will haunt your dreams and harrow -- YES -- your very soul.
 
INT. BARKER'S BOOTH - CONTINUING
Hold a still frame on Simon and Kaylee, staring intently at something in a big jar that we can't see very well. Wait a beat.
SIMON: Yep. It's a cow fetus.
KAYLEE: Guess so... Does seem to have an awful lot of limbs... But cow? How do you figure?
SIMON: It's upside down.
She cranes her head upside down, looks. Nods, sagely...
KAYLEE: Oh, Yeah. Cow.
SIMON: Yup. And I'm out twelve bits. I really know how to show a girl a... disgusting time.
KAYLEE: Oh, it's sweet. Poor little thing never even saw the light of day, now it's in show business!
He looks at her, admiringly.
SIMON: You manage to find the bright side of every single thing.
KAYLEE: (coming closer) Also, we've got this booth to ourselves for five whole minutes...
SIMON: (glances at jar) We're not alone, remember?
KAYLEE: (taking his hands) He's not gonna squawk. Tell me more good stuff about me.
SIMON: (smiles) Ah... Well, you're a, a kind of a genius when it comes to machines... you always say what you mean, and your eyes are...
KAYLEE: Yeah? Eyes, yeah?
SIMON: And, um... I don't know how to, um... (joking) Plus, every other girl I know is either married, professional, or closely related to me, so you're more or less, you are literally the only girl in the world.
Those famous eyes of her darken considerably. She draws back.
KAYLEE: Mm. That's a hell of a thing to say.
SIMON: I was joking...
KAYLEE: No, no, I get it. I do. Back on Osiris you probably had nurses and debutantes crawling all over you. But down here at the bottom of the barrel, it's just me.
SIMON: No, that's, that's, that's not even --
KAYLEE: Well, I'm glad I rated higher than dead bessie here. < Why don't you tell the cow about its beautiful eyes? > [Nee GAO-soo NA niou, TA yo shwong mei-moo?]
She is storming out just as Wash and Zoe are coming in. Simon watches Kaylee despairingly.
WASH: Oh my god, he's grotesque! Oh, and there's something in a jar.
He ogles the fetus as Zoe come up to Simon.
ZOE: Scare her away again, did you?
SIMON: This may come as a shock, but I'm actually not very good at, at talking to girls.
ZOE: (not unkindly) Why, is there someone you ARE good at talking to?
WASH: (in the background, to the jar) Do not fear me. Ours is a peaceful race, and we must live in harmony...  

INT. BAZAAR - CONTINUING
Mal and Inara walk through, talking.
INARA: Struck out again, did you?
MAL: It's like something out of a fable! I've got this priceless artifact, the biggest score of my unseemly career, and no one will touch it.
INARA: The Lassiter's universally known. Fencing it is like... fencing the Mona Lisa.
MAL: Well... (nonchalantly snags an urchin picking his pocket and retrieves his property) Mona Who?
INARA: You're out of your league. You should consider my offer --
MAL: I done thinking about that, and you ought to stay clear.
INARA: I know people in the highest ranks of --
MAL: Jabber jabber jabber. I ain't listening. Just 'cause you helped out on the job don't make you a crook. I will not have you jeopardizing your career over this.
INARA: The career you abhor and look down on?
MAL: I just don't want you in the way a'trouble. Just take it as you like. (calling out) Amnon, How you been?
They have reached a more official looking section of the bazaar, with a sign reading: POST, FREIGHT and HOLDING.
AMNON DUUL, the postman, wears a sort of combination of a postal uniform and hasidic wear. He is decent and more or less unflappable, and happy to see Mal. 
AMNON: (shaking his hand) Malcolm, an old friend's face is a balm in this age.
MAL: I read your wave. You're holding some post for me?
AMNON: Yeah. Got yourself quite a haul. You can sign for everyone, right?
MAL: Sure.
AMNON: Very good.
Amnon goes into a back room as Mal starts filling out a form.
Book arrives, with River in tow. They both hold short sticks that dangle strings off the end. Each string runs through the middle of a ball of ice cream that is supported by a bowl shaped cookie attached (under the ice cream) to the string. They're sort of like little mace and chains, and eating them is not altogether convenient, since they swing a bit.
BOOK: Any packages for me?
MAL: Don't know yet.
RIVER: My food is problematic.
Jayne arrives, toting a couple boxes of ammo.
JAYNE: Girl's a mind-readin' genius, can't even figure out how to eat a ice-planet.
MAL: Did you get everything?
JAYNE: Yeah. They didn't have no rounds for the Buhnder, but we're ammoed up pretty good. Got a good discount on account of my intimidating manner --
Jayne gives Mal his change. Mal looks at the paltry amount. As though just remembering, Jayne digs out more money and hands it to Mal.
Amnon returns, wheeling in a man-sized crate. He tosses a couple of smaller package on the counter.
AMNON: This one's addressed to you and Zoe, Mal.
MAL: I don't remember ordering any parts...
He signs some forms.
AMNON: The little one's for Cobb.
Jayne hurried puts the ammo on the counter and takes the small package.
JAYNE: I got post?
BOOK: Might we all want to step a few paces back before he opens that?
JAYNE: Haw haw. It's from my mother.
During this, Inara sees Kaylee arrive, looking glum.
INARA: (to Kaylee) So, do aliens live among us?
KAYLEE: Yeah. One of them's a doctor.
Jayne tears open his package and pulls out a letter.
Zoe and Wash wander up with Simon trailing behind as Jayne reads, with the classic toneless hesitation of a slow reader:
JAYNE: "My dear boy. I hope you are well and that you get this soon in your travels." Travels.
Inara puts her arm around Kaylee, Kaylee putting her head on Inara's shoulder.
AS JAYNE CONTINUES: Mal motions for Zoe to help him.
MAL: Did you order any equipment?
ZOE: No sir.
JAYNE: "Thank you for the credits you forwarded, they have helped as Matty is still sick with the Damp-lung. I made you the enclosed" --
As Zoe and Mal inspect the grate, Jayne digs in the box --
JAYNE: Ooh! Enclosed!
He reaches in and pulls out a woolly knitted hat with earflaps and a pom pom. He is clearly moved. He puts it on, continues reading.
JAYNE: -- "enclosed to keep you warm in your travels. Hope to hear from you soon, love, your mother."
He closes the letter, proudly adjusting his hat.
JAYNE: How's it sit? Pretty cunning, don'tchya think?
It's faintly ridiculous, but are you gonna tell him that? Anyway, Kaylee likes it, wistful as she is.
KAYLEE: I think it's the sweetest hat ever.
WASH: Man walks down the street in that hat, people know he's not afraid of anything.
JAYNE: Damn straight.
Mal and Zoe are just finishing unlocking the crate, trying to pry it open.
MAL: Well, let's hope we get some funny hats, too.
As he's saying it, they pry the lid off, and we see a coffin. Then they open the coffin, and we see the corpse of a young man lying, arms folded, inside.
Mal and Zoe look at him with somber recognition. Everyone goes very quiet, looking inside.
The last to bother is Jayne, who cranes his head into frame, hat still perched proudly, looking quizzically at the body.
JAYNE: What'd you all order a dead guy for?

 
INT. /EXT. BUDDIST TEMPLE - NIGHT
A firefight is going full blazes outside. Soldiers battle fiercely.
Just inside the temple we see TRACEY, who is a green but gutsy private. Right now he's sweaty and tense. He looks out over the remains of a wall slowly, looking for enemies.
Light from the occasional explosion or far away burst of gunfire gives us a better view of the place -- it's being held by about six Independents, all looking out in different directions.
Tracey sees nothing. He takes a moment and lays down his weapon. Reaches into his bag and pulls out a can of beans. As he does, mumbling to himself about beans, we see an Alliance Soldier creeping towards him from the other side of the wall. Tracey doesn't see --
-- Till the guy's foot hits a rock -- Tracey moves, scrambling for his rifle -- too late as the Alliance Soldier raises his --
CLOSE ON: The Alliance Solder -- as Zoe calmly appears behind him and draws a knife across his throat.
Angle on: Tracey -- as a few blood splatters hit his face.
Zoe drops the soldier and enters, taking the extra rifle.
TRACEY: Thanks. I didn't know you were out there.
ZOE: (stone cold) Sort of the point. Stealth, you may have heard of it.
TRACEY: I don't think they covered that in basic.
ZOE: Well, at least they covered 'Dropping your weapon so you can eat beans and get yourself shot'.
TRACEY: Yeah, I got a badge in that. (off her look) Won't happen again.
ZOE: It does, I'm just gonna watch.
TRACEY: Anything interesting out there, you don't mind my asking?
ZOE: (indicating) 'Bout 30 troops behind those buildings. Mortars, no rollers yet. I expect they plan to pick at us a spell before they charge. They had two scouts sniffin, but I took 'em down.
TRACEY: (impressed) Why, I didn't hear a single thing.
ZOE: First rule of battle, little one. Don't ever let them know where you are.
Mal runs in, screaming and firing behind him, and dives over a wall for cover, lands nearby, bullets zinging over his head.
MAL: I'm right here! I'm right here! Come on!
Mal continues to taunt the enemy.
ZOE: 'Course, there are other schools of thought...
Mal scrambles over to them, laughing.
MAL: Ha! That was bracing. They don't like it when you shoot at them. I worked that out myself.
ZOE: Did you find Vitelli?
MAL: Vitelli's out of it. That bumblebee laid down arms at the first sign of inevitable crushing defeat. Can you imagine such a cowardly creature?
TRACEY: Southwest corridor's open, huh?
MAL: Tracey. Ain't you dead yet?
TRACEY: (looking sheepishly at Zoe) Through no fault of my own.
MAL: (disappointed) I really wanted your beans.
ZOE: They're gonna come right through here. They got rollers?
MAL: Oh, they got every damn thing. How's the lieutenant?
TRACEY: He started screaming. All of a sudden, about his arms, where's his arms, we hadda go back and find 'em.  
ZOE: What the hell happened?
TRACEY: He ain't even hurt! Got ten pretty fingers on his hands like the most of men, but he's screaming like they're gone, crying. He ain't said a word in two hours.
MAL: (mournful anger) These kids...
ZOE: Sir. Do we hold?
TRACEY: (breaking a bit) I don't want to die here. Forgive me saying, this rock ain't worth it. Not our lives.
MAL: Everybody dies, Tracey. Someone's carrying a bullet for you right now, doesn't even know it. (smiles) The trick is, die of old age before it finds you.
ZOE: We can still cut through to the 22nd at the school system. Make a decent stand there. 
MAL: Well, we can't do any good here. I sure as hell ain't going to lay down arms. Zoe, you heard the Lieutenant give the order to join up with the 22nd?
ZOE: I did.
MAL: Round 'em up, then. (to Tracey) And you also heard the lieutenant, too.
TRACEY: Hey, I ain't gonna rat you out, Sarge, hell I --
MAL: Ain't me I'm worried on. Lieutenant ever gets his mind back together, this shouldn't go on his record. Ain't his fault he couldn't take it.
TRACEY: More than he'd probably do --
Mal raises a hand, intense, for quiet. Tracey doesn't get it, doesn't hear the growing whine of --
ZOE: SEEKER!
Things happen very quickly. Zoe dives for cover as Mal pulls a flare from his belt that activates the moment he touches it, hurls it above his head --
-- and a tiny missile zooms at the group, suddenly turning up, hitting the flair 30 feet up --
The explosion lights up the air, Mal also diving over Tracey as shrapnel rains down --
TRACEY: AAGH!
Mal is hit in the back and arm. He rolls off Tracey, who's taken it in the leg pretty badly.
TRACEY: Is it bad? Is it bad?
MAL: (ignoring his own wounds) It's glorious. (calls out) Come on! We gotta move!
TRACEY: I can't...
Explosions and gunfire continue.
MAL: You got to run! (to Zoe) Zoe! Get the Lieutenant!
TRACEY: (in pain) Sarge, really...
MAL: You know the old saying...
He hoists Tracey over his shoulder and runs just as a tank bursts through the wall -- 
 
INT. BAZAAR - CONTINUING (PRESENT DAY)
Close up of that same Tracey, all stiff and dead and blue.
After a moment, Mal slides the lid back over him.
MAL: Why, it don't make any kind of sense. Zoe?
ZOE: I got nothing. But it's definitely Tracey.
WASH: You know this guy?
INARA: Is this a warning of some kind?
AMNON: (quietly) Listen, Mal, you gotta get this thing out of my station. (Mal starts to object) No, no, no, no. Human transport on a postal route is very very illegal. If anyone even knows I took a corpse in, I'll lose my franchise.
MAL: Well who sent it?
AMNON: I don't know. There's no return.
ZOE: How long has it been here?
AMNON: Near a week, that's why I waved you. This can't stay here.
JAYNE: He don't smell.
MAL: I know. Ben decently preserved. (to Zoe) Give me a hand.
JAYNE: We're taking him on board?
MAL: We are.
JAYNE: Don't know if I see the percentage in that.
MAL: Well, don't strain your brain trying. Might break something.
Mal and Zoe haul the box up, start walking. Book moves to help --
ZOE: (stony) We got it.
They cart him off, the others folding in behind, quietlike. Simon approaches, oblivious, hoping to win Kaylee into a conversation.
SIMON: What's going on? Did we get something fun?
A glare for Simon. River passes him, ice cream swinging --
RIVER: You are such a boob.

INT. CARGO BAY - A BIT LATER
The box is open again. Everyone is about.
JAYNE: How do we know he ain't plague-ridden or some such?
ZOE: We know.
WASH: We don't, actually. I mean, I respect you guys have a history, but... What are you doing? 
Zoe is reaching in, pulling something from the corpses folded hands.
SIMON: (to Mal) If you want me to do a proper autopsy --
KAYLEE: Cut him up?
MAL: Not just yet, thank you doctor.
KAYLEE: (muttering) Robot.
Zoe produces a FUTURISTIC DEVICE! That is a tape recorder -- of the FUTURE!
MAL: What do you got?
She turns it on. The voice stops them all. It is hesitant at first, and weak, as though the talker were straining for breath, But soon settles into a rhythm...
TRACEY: (V.O.) Uh. Okay. Um, recording... Hi, I guess. This is a message for Zoe, and for Malcolm Reynolds, and I really hope you all are the ones listening to it.
We move over everyone as they listen, soberly.
TRACEY: I'll spare you the boring details, falling in with untrustworthy folk, making a bunch of bad calls... All that matters is I expect to be shuffled off, and you two are the only people I trust to get me where I'm going. Which is home. I'd like my body to be with my folks on St. Albans. We got the family plot there, and my Mom and dad, well, they deserve to know I died. You know, it's funny. We went to the war never looking to come back, but it's the real world I couldn't survive. You two carried me through that war. Now I need you to carry me just a little bit further. If you can. Tell my folks I wanted to do right by them and that I'm at peace and all. Ah. When you can't run anymore, you crawl, and when you can't do that... well, yeah, you know the rest. Thanks, both of you. Oh. Yeah. And, uh... Make sure my eyes is closed, will you?
A moment, and the tape ends. Everyone is quiet.
Wash rises, heads to the stairs --
MAL: Wash?
Wash turns back.
WASH: St. Albans ain't but a two day ride, we burn hard enough.
A moment, and Mal nods. Wash continues up and Mal turns to replace the lid again, says to Inara:
MAL: That might make your schedule a little --
INARA: It's all right.
He nods again, not much with the verbal thank you's right at this moment. He and Zoe lift the top together --

EXT. SPACE BAZAAR - MOMENTS LATER
Silent but for music, we see Serenity gently lifting off. It passes another ship -- a slightly larger, ALLIANCE SHORT RANGE ENFORCEMENT VESSEL. It's basically an oversized, beat up squad car. As it lands right near where Serenity took off, the music changes to indicate this might be not wonderful.
 
INT. BAZAAR - MOMENTS LATER
We TRACK BEHIND three men as they stride through the Bazaar. If they're cops, they're detectives, since they have no uniforms to speak of. The man in the middle is called WOMACK. He's been around the block, and likely beaten up everybody on it. The other two, FENDRIS and SKUNK, aren't much different, but they clearly defer to Womack.
They make their way through the place with purposeful indifference. Pass the barker:
BARKER: That's right, gentlemen, you have been told tales all your life, but Alien races exist among us, the proof is right inside, you'll be amazed and astounded...
Womack and his men enter the postal center,.
Amnon is going through papers, behind his counter. He arranges them carefully --
Womack holds up his badge.
Amnon looks up to see Womack standing right in front of him. Amnon hesitates, and before anything can happen Skunk is already going in his back room to search. Fendris is behind Womack, checking his rather large pistol and watching out for pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.
AMNON: Can I help you...?
WOMACK: You are an ugly looking little quim, you know that?
AMNON: Look, there's a problem, you know, I can --
WOMACK: (wanders about the room, snooping, circling like a shark around its prey) So you might to be asking yourself, ugly as you are, how repulsive looking the guy that's going to make you his little woman is gonna be. Hmm? I mean, prison is a lonely place, and you sure as a hundred moons ain't gonna be pitching. So what kind of sorry ass troll is gonna get blue enough to grapple with you? Shudder to think.
AMNON: I've broken no law.
WOMACK: Transportation of human cargo -- especially dead cargo -- (thumps Amnon on the forehead) through the Allied postal system is punishable by five to ten years on a penal moon. Plus, you don't know this yet, but you resisted arrest. (off Amnon's terror) Where's my body?
AMNON: I, I... I don't know. I, I...
WOMACK: The dead guy. He got shipped here.
Skunk comes out, shakes his head no.
WOMACK: And shipped back out, I guess. Where?
AMNON: I never saw a body. (Womack starts to turn ahead) But, but wait, there was a, there was a, there was a crate big enough for one, I mean, I mean, I did hand that over just a little while ago.
WOMACK: Lovely. Who got it?
Amnon hands over the register, points to a name.
WOMACK: Malcolm Reynolds. Where do you suppose he's off to?
AMNON: He, he captain's a firefly, you-you should be able to capture him if you leave now.
WOMACK: Are you telling me to leave?
AMNON: Well, no, no, I didn't, I...
WOMACK: Relax, you've been great. And I was just bluffing with that stuff about arresting you, I mean, who needs that kind of paperwork? Skunk. Light him on fire.
AMNON: No! I-I-I-I.
Skunk sprays Amnon with lighter fluid he keeps in a cool container in his jacket.
AMNON: I, I told you. I told you what I know! What? What? I --
With swift graceful motion, Skunk holds up a suddenly lit match. Amnon backs into a huddle in the corner, utterly terrified.
Womack stands next to skunk, over the cowering postman.
WOMACK: Tell anyone we were here, warn (looks at the register) "Captain Reynolds" that we're coming, and you'll wish that we'd burned you. < understand? > [Dong ma?]
Amnon nods frantically.
WOMACK: Boys... let's go find us a corpse. 
He blows out Skunk's match.
 
 
INT. ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT
Kaylee lies in her hammock, listening to the recording of Tracey's voice. She clearly has been doing this for a while, and has gotten awful misty about the lad.
TRACEY: (V.O.) I really hope you all are the ones listening to it. I'll spare you the boring details, falling in with untrustworthy folk, making a bunch of bad calls... All that matters is I expect to be shuffled off, and you two are the only people I trust to get me where I'm going. Which is home. I'd like my body to be with my folks on St. Albans. We got the family plot there, and my Mom and dad, well, they deserve to know I died. You know, it's funny. We went to the war never looking to come back, but it's the real world I couldn't survive.
 
INT. AFT HALL - CONTINUING
Simon comes up, looking for Kaylee. He stops outside the engine room door. Sees her, hears the recording...
Simon slowly slips away, realizing with regret he is unwanted.
 
INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING
Book stands at the head of the crate/coffin, bible in hand, head bowed. WIDEN to see that during his little silent service, Jayne is busily lifting weights. Jayne replaces the barbell in its holder, the metal noisily clattering. Book looks around.
JAYNE: Oh, sorry, Preacher. Am I makin' too much noise?
BOOK: No, no, I was just.... saying a few words. Don't know the boy's denomination, but...
JAYNE: Oh, no. It's good. The Lord should oughta look after the dead.
Over the following, Jayne pats himself down with a towel -- he's quite sweaty. Really been going at it.
JAYNE: You wanna do a set? I'll spot you.
BOOK: Not so terribly in the mood.
JAYNE: Yeah. Most people is pretty quiet about now. Me, I see a stiff -- one I didn't have to kill myself -- I just get the urge to, you know, do stuff. Work out or run around, maybe get some trim if there's a willin' woman about... not that I get flush from corpses or anything. I ain't crazy.
BOOK: Makes sense. Looking to feel alive, I would venture.
JAYNE: For psychology, that don't sound half dumb. My kind of life don't last long, Preacher. So I expect I'm invested in making good sport of it whilst I can.
He puts on his hat as he says it.
As they continue talking, we come around to see River in the background, crawling gracefully onto the coffin. She stretches, catlike, moving her head about in odd fashion, as though listening, then lies flat on her belly, arms out to her sides.
JAYNE: You gonna read over me when I get taken down, Shepherd?
BOOK: Oh, I suspect you'll be around long after we're all --
JAYNE: (noticing River) (What the hell is she: in Chinese) (at River) -- what the hell are you doing?
BOOK: Oh. River, that might not be the best place to...
RIVER: I'm very comfortable.
They consider pulling her off... hesitate...
BOOK: (to Jayne) I guess we do all have different reactions to death.

INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUING
Mal and Zoe are laughing their asses off. We widen to see Inara is with them, laughing as well. They've all had a few drinks, and continue to drink as they talk:
MAL: I thought I was gonna die.
INARA: How could he possibly have even...
MAL: Oh, the colonel was dead drunk. Three hours pissing on about the enlisted men, uh, they're scum, uh, they're not fighters -- and, uh, and then he passed right out. Boom.
ZOE: We couldn't even move him. So, uh, Tracey just snipped it right off his face.
MAL: And you never seen a man more proud of his mustache than Colonel Orbrin. In all my life I will never love a woman the way this officer loved that lip ferret.
ZOE: Big walrussy thing, all waxed up...
INARA: Did he find out?
Another burst of laughter from Mal and Zoe. 
MAL: Oh! The next morning, he wakes up, it's gone, and he is furious, but he can't just say, you know, "someone stole my mustache." So he, uh, calls together all the platoons --
ZOE: We thought he was gonna shoot us --
MAL: And, uh, oh, he's eyeballing all the men something fierce, not a word, and he comes up to Tracey... and Tracey's wearing the gorram thing on his face.
ZOE: He had glued it on.
MAL: Staring the old man down, wearing his own damn mustache. Huh. Uh. Oh god...
The laughter falters, Mal looking into his drink a moment. Inara looks at him sympathetically, tries to jump start the conversation again:
INARA: Well, the colonel must have said SOME --
The SHIP ROCKS with force of an explosion. They all start out of their chairs.
ZOE: We hit?
MAL: That's too damn close --
And they are racing to the
 
INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING
Where Wash is piloting intently.
WASH: They're behind us. Fired over the port bow.
MAL: Warning shot?
WASH: They coulda hit us...
ZOE: Feds.
The screen comes to life, Womack's face on it.
WOMACK: This is Lieutenant Womack of Allied Enforcement. You are in possession of stolen goods and are ordered to cut thrust and prepare for docking.
MAL: The Lassiter.
ZOE: That was quick.
INARA: Think Saffron tipped them off?
Mal hits the screen com:
MAL: This is captain Reynolds, I think there's been a mistake.
WOMACK: There's been a lot of mistakes, Captain. The latest of which is you taking that crate.
He looks at the others. 'Crate?'
MAL: (to Womack) Um. We took in a lot of inventory today. If something got mixed in, we'll be sure hand it back, but I don't think we're your men. Let me check through the cargo -- is it marked at all?
WOMACK: I'd think twice about playing games with me there, mister. I will blow you to pieces.
MAL: Ah, you do that, your precious crate gonna be in bitty shards. Now I got deliveries to make, officer, so you just lock onto my trajectory, and I'll take a look here, see if there's anything here matches your description.
He turns off the screen.
WASH: Police procedure has changed since I was little.
MAL: He calls back, you keep him occupied.
WASH: What do I do, shadow puppets?
BOOK: We'll take care of it.
ZOE: I don't get this. They're after Tracey?
MAL: Or there's something else in that box.
 
INT. CARGO BAY - MOMENTS LATER
Tracey's body lies on the floor as Mal, Zoe and Jayne go through both the crate and the box, looking for something. The others including Simon, Inara and River (minus Wash and Book) look on.
MAL: Anything?
JAYNE: (smashing planks) Not unless this crate's made a' magical wish-granting planks.
MAL: (to Zoe) Check his pockets.  
KAYLEE: That ain't right...
MAL: Neither's being blowd up. There's nothing about this sits right with me.
ZOE: Empty.
MAL: Well, they want this body for something, and I'm guessing it ain't a proper burial.
Looks around. No option. Looks to Simon:
MAL: Well, doctor... I guess you are doing an autopsy.

INT. INFIRMARY - LATER
Mal, Zoe and Jayne watch as Simon prepares to open up the now naked (but sheet covered) body.
ZOE: You really think there's something in there.
MAL: Using corpses for smuggling is a time-honored repulsive custom.
JAYNE: Maybe it's gold!
ZOE: And maybe he was a friend of ours, and you need to show a little respect.
JAYNE: I got respect. I'm just saying... gold...
SIMON: He's been opened before.
MAL: How's that?
SIMON: It's, uh... It's good work. The scar's nearly invisible, but...
He traces his finger all the way down the chest.
MAL: Well, let's see what's in there.
He looks at Zoe, hating this. A tense moment. Simon takes his scalpel and starts cutting.
And Tracey SCREAMS.

 
INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY
Where we left off. Everyone backing away from the SCREAMING Lazarus. Tracey looks with horror to his bleeding chest, then to the man who holds the scalpel -- Simon. Simon sees the blood, makes an instinctive move to see to the wound. All Tracey sees is the knife. He gives a PRIMAL CRY as he lunges off the table at Simon. They struggle, knocking shit over. Mal and Zoe jump into the fray. Mal calling to Jayne:
MAL: Get a hold of him!
JAYNE: Spry for a dead fella!
Mal pins him to the floor, ends up sitting on top of him.
MAL: Settle down! SETTLE! That's enough!
TRACEY: He was cuttin' on me, Sarge!
MAL: I know it! I told him to!
TRACEY: You told him to! What for?!
MAL: You were dead!
TRACEY: (coming back to him) Hunh? Oh. Right. I know, I suppose I was. (sees Zoe) Hey there, Zoe.
ZOE: Private.
MAL: You feeling a mite calmer now?
TRACEY: Yes, Sarge. (then) Um. Sarge?
MAL: Yeah?
TRACEY: I think I'm nekked.
A beat. Mal's straddling a naked man.
Tracey rises. Looks a bit sheepish. Pulls the sheet up around his waist as he sits on the edge of the table. As Simon starts to tend to the wound:
TRACEY: Sorry for jumping on you the way I did. I was a little confounded.
SIMON: Emerging from that state can be disorienting. Was it byphodine? (casually, to Jayne) Will you bring that pan, please.
Jayne, not knowing why, brings a bedpan over. Simon positions Jayne's hand with pan in front of Tracey without explanation, then moves to his med supplies.
SIMON: (clarifying) The drug you took to make it appear as though you were dead. Do you remember what it was called?
TRACEY: Never did ask. Guy who sold it to me said I'd be under a week or so. He told me I wouldn't dream. But I did. I dreamt of my family.
Simon has moved back to his patient, reaches out, repositions the bedpan as Tracey suddenly HEAVES forward. Jayne reacts. Simon doesn't, was expecting it. Gives Tracey a shot:
SIMON: (to grossed-out Jayne) You can take that.
Simon goes about checking Tracey's vitals, hooking him up tothe scanners and reading the monitor in the b.g.
MAL: All right. You want to explain to me exactly why you got yourself all corpseified and mailed to me? What're you running from?
TRACEY: Running to, not from. I just wanted to get home is all. That's all I ever wanted. 'cept there's them that take exception to that. To me leaving... while I was in possession of their property...
MAL: What'd you boost, Tracey?
JAYNE: (eagerly) Was it gold?
MAL: More importantly, who'd you boost it from?
TRACEY: Well...
SIMON: Captain, I don't mean to... We may have a medical emergency here... 
They all look at him; he's looking at the monitor.
SIMON: This man appears to be in cardiac arrest...
MAL: What? Tracey, you having a heart attack? (to Simon) Don't look like he's having a heart attack...
TRACEY: (laughs) Don't pay any attention to your machines, doc. They'll fib to ya. Heart's just fine. Better'n fine. Just runs a little hotter'n usual, that's all.
SIMON: (off, monitors) My god... it's not just the heart muscle... it's everything...
TRACEY: All the movin' parts. That's what I took, Mal. That's what they want back.
MAL: Tracey -- you going to tell me what in the < name of all that's sacred > [TYEN shiao-duh] you're talking about?
TRACEY: (distracted) Sure, Sarge... sure...
Now the MONITOR really starts to go nuts, Tracey's heartbeating ever faster. The others look from the monitor to him, then follow his gaze to...
KAYLEE stands in the doorway, staring at the man come back to life. They hold the look between them.
 
INT. SERENITY - COMMON AREA - (SHORT TIME) LATER
Mal, Zoe, Jayne, Simon, Kaylee and Tracey. Kaylee brings Tracey some water. They will have silent connection throughout the following.
TRACEY: Thank you.
She smiles at him, takes a seat.
MAL: So your innards... ain't your innards?
TRACEY: They got scooped out, replaced every bit.
JAYNE: Why'd you wanna go and do that?
TRACEY: For the money. They're paying me to transport what they stuck in.
ZOE: You're smuggling human organs?
TRACEY: They're grown in a lab. The only way they can move them is in a person. Not sure why.
SIMON: Because the technology's not ready. The blastomeres are unapproved. Likely unstable. You're not just a carrier -- you're an incubator.
TRACEY: I was supposed to be at the drop spot two weeks ago. A clinic in Ariel. They were to open me up, take out the goods and put my own workings back.
MAL: So what happened?
TRACEY: Better offer. Another buyer was willing to go three times the going rate. It's enough so I could get my folks off that rock they've been forced to live on, set them up someplace better, someplace warm.
KAYLEE: That's real nice.
MAL: But your '"better offer" went south...
TRACEY: Yeah, I got myself into a little bit of a pickle, Sarge. The folks I was working for musta got wind of what I had planned. I, uh, showed up... my new buyer was dead. And there were some men, waitin' for me.
KAYLEE: But you got away.
TRACEY: Only just. I knew they'd never stop looking for me so long as I was alive. Thought my chances'd be better if I weren't.
MAL: So you "died" and figured they'd stop looking for you.
TRACEY: Yupper.
A SUDDEN BLAST from outside. The ship ROCKS with the impact.
Tracey reacts with fear.
MAL: I think maybe you figured wrong.

EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING
The Police Cruiser is behind Serenity, pacing. It lets loose with another ELECTRONIC BLAST.
 
INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - CONTINUING
Wash and Book on the bridge. As Mal and Zoe and Jayne enter behind them:
 
WASH: I think they're 'about done being stalled -- Ah! Yeow!
He's just laid eyes on Tracey, who stands in the doorway with Kaylee. Book takes in the sight with interest.
WASH: Mal! Your dead army buddy's on the bridge!
ZOE: He ain't dead.
WASH: Oh.
MAL: How far are we to St. Albans?
WASH: Five minutes from atmo.
MAL: Bring up the terrain specs. Kaylee, get him out of here. And strap in.
Wash brings up terrain maps on the nav monitor. Mal grabs the radio mic, speaks.
MAL: This is Captain Reynolds.
WOMACK: Reynolds. I'm a dangerous-minded man on a ship loaded with hurt. Now why you got me chatting with your peons?
MAL: (off mic) Tracey. You go on down below. We'll handle this. (on mic) Ah. Oo, ah. Well. We're just seeing to some technical difficulties, officer.
WOMACK: Not interested, Captain. I stepped over a lot of bodies to get to that one you got in your hold. You play this right, and yours won't have to be among them.
TRACEY: (scared) Sarge...
ZOE: The Captain ordered you off the bridge.
KAYLEE: Come on.
She starts to lead him away. Mal pages through maps.
MAL: Uh. We'd love to let you boys dock, but that last pop you gave us knocked out our fore-couple, so we're gonna have to park it if you want the tour.
WOMACK: All right, Captain. We can do this on the ground just as easy. (signs off)
MAL: Yeah. Easy. (points to map) (to Wash) There. Think you can do it?
WASH: Watch me.
Mal clicks over the feed on the mic, now when he speaks it's an internal SHIP PA.
MAL: (AMPLIFIED) Attention, crew. This is the captain. Sit down and hang on to something...

EXT. SPACE/ATMO - CONTINUING
As Serenity, followed by cops, dips down, heads for a PLANET. Breaking atmo, speeding up, taking a dive, as...
 
INT. SERENITY - KAYLEE'S BUNK - CONTINUING
Kaylee is coming down the ladder into her room. As the ship heads into the dive, she is sent into Tracey's arms. He catches her. Holds her. They look at each other as.
TRACEY: Uh. You okay?
Kaylee nods
TRACEY: So, I, I can let go of you now.
KAYLEE: Oh, you can.
TRACEY: Yeah.
KAYLEE: (sits on her bunk) All this hard bankin', when the gravity drive and actual gravity start working against each other, it tosses the lunch about a bit.
TRACEY: Pilot's pretty wild.
KAYLEE: Oh, he can thread a need with this bird. He's the best.
TRACEY: (still standing, hanging on with one hand) That's good to know.
Kaylee smiles, nods.
TRACEY: (hesitantly) So, are you and he, uh...
KAYLEE: Sweeties? (laughs) Oh, hell no! He's married to Zoe.
TRACEY: (incredulous) Zoe got married?
KAYLEE: Yeah.
TRACEY: (laughs) Yeah, next you'll be telling me she smiles -- (he sits, comfortable now) -- has emotions.
KAYLEE: She must have been such a stone-cold <shion tse sha sho> during the war.
TRACEY: I think the Sarge was even a little bit afraid of her. Now she's married. That's good! People making a life for each other.

EXT. ST. ALBANS
Serenity dives into mountains followed by the police ship.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - CONTINUING
WOMACK: (ON VID) Had enough of this goose run. Don't need no attitude on this ice cube. Now let's park it!
WASH: Just, uh, looking for a good spot, officer.
WOMACK: You got thirty seconds to set it down.
Zoe comes up to Book.
ZOE: What is it?
BOOK: It's just a little strange. There's a defense station right here, but our friends haven't made a transmission since they broke atmo.

EXT. ICE CANYONS - CONTINUING
Serenity dives through snowy canyons. Serenity thrillingly zooms among the twisty canyons.
 
INT. SERENITY - KAYLEE'S BUNK - CONTINUING
KAYLEE: So what about you?
TRACEY: Oh, you know, mostly just --
Serenity rocks violently. Tracey wangs the back of his head. Kaylee, sympathetic, reaches towards him, almost but not quite daring to touch him.
TRACEY: Stuff like this. Just finding myself in one scrape or another. Sorry to drag you all into this.
KAYLEE: (blase) Oh! Danger's pretty much our business.
TRACEY: Still. If you got put in a bad spot at all, Kaylee, I... I'd be real unhappy.
Kaylee beams her pleasure at his sweet concern.
 
INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - CONTINUING
Wash pilots.
WASH: Get ready for hard burn -- (leans on controls) They'd be crazy to follow us in here.
 
EXT. ICE CANYONS - CONTINUING
The police Cruiser paces them.
 
INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - CONTINUING
WASH: They're not behind us anymore.
Wash glances up through the top of the bridge windows...
WASH: (sees the police ship) I didn't think of that...
 
EXT. ICE CANYONS - CONTINUING
Cops follow placidly just above the canyon, pacing. BELOW, Serenity is having a tougher time of it as it maneuvers through the ever more precarious canyons.
Police ship shoots at Serenity, blasts a mountain side free. Serenity is tossed about. Everyone hangs on for dear life. Wash frantically maneuvers to evade the cascading wall of debris.
 
INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - CONTINUING
WASH: Wow! 'Kay! Ah! This kind of flying really wakes a guy up.
MAL: (hanging tightly to Serenity) Awake helps.

EXT. ICE CANYONS - CONTINUING
Serenity goes behind a curve, disappears for an instant, Reappears, then disappears again... then doesn't re-appear. The Police Cruiser circles, looking. No sign.
 
EXT. /INT. ICE CANYONS/CAVE - CONTINUING
As Serenity backs into ice cave.
 
INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - CONTINUING
WASH: There. Now. I shut down the main power. They might not read our auxillary under all this.
MAL: What if they come down, try to get a visual?
WASH: Mal, she's not a small ship.
 
INT. SERENITY - KAYLEE'S BUNK - CONTINUING
TRACEY: We're not moving. Why aren't we moving?
KAYLEE: Probably part of some genius plan to give the feds the slip.
TRACEY: (not believing it) Yeah. Probably.
A DEEP BOOMING from somewhere. Lights flicker on and off.
TRACEY: What was that?
 
INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - CONTINUING
ZOE: It sounds like <wuo duh> mag drops.
WASH: I think they picked up a little triangulation in cop school.
 
EXT. ICE CANYONS - CONTINUING
Where WE SEE Police Cruiser dropping magnetic depth charges.
 
INT. SERENITY - HOLD
River is sitting on stairs, holding on. Simon walks up.
RIVER: A thousand one. A thousand two...
SIMON: River...?
RIVER: Shh... I'm counting between lightning and thunder to see if the storm's coming or going. Thousand five.
 
INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - CONTINUING
MAL: Options?
WASH: Well, we're only as good as long as the roof hold out. Direct hit above us, ship's electricals'll be fried. We'll have to climb out.
JAYNE: Yeah. Get dug out.
ZOE: Getting closer.
BOOK: Captain, there is another way.
 
INT. SERENITY - KAYLEE'S BUNK - CONTINUING
Tracey starts towards the ladder.
KAYLEE: Uh. Captain said to stay put.
TRACEY: (opens door) I just want to see what's happening.
 
INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING
BOOK: (to Mal, face-to-face, close) We're cornered, outgunned, and it's only a matter of time before they find us, what's left of us.
ZOE: Whadda you sayin', Preacher?
BOOK: I'm saying we make good on what we said we were gonna do. Let's call them. Fly out of this canyon. Let 'em board.
Tracey arrives at this juncture, listens intently, worried. 
JAYNE: Give ourselves up.
BOOK: It's our only choice.
MAL: We let these men board, we're taking an awful chance. These boys ain't playing, Preacher.
BOOK: I'm aware of that.
Tracey suddenly looks a bit dark and shifty, eyeing some nearby weapons...

 
INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING
Sweat-beaded brows, a beat of nervous silence, held breaths.
Then from above a rolling THUNDEROUS BOOM. The bridge vibrates with the OS explosion's force. A cascade of ICE CHUNKS clatters over the windshield and the nose of Serenity.
Wash lets out his breath, checking some of his dash monitors.
WASH: < Mother-of-Jesus > [Wuo duh MA] That one was really close.
Jayne turns from the debris still falling to the others. He's extra sweaty, falling prey to his cowardly side.
JAYNE: That tears it. I'm with the preacher. I ain't gettin' snowed-in permanent on account of some jackass kid --
ANOTHER BOOM FROM ABOVE - throughout this scene, the depth charges are a slow, regular drum beat, adding rhythmic percussion to the tenseness.
BOOK: (quiet conviction) It's the only option, Captain.
Mal turns to Zoe. They exchange a look. Zoe gives a slight nod - 'can't think of anything else to do'. Mal nods back.
MAL: Wash... Call the cops. Tell them we give up.
Wash nods and flicks the RADIO ON, preparing to call.
TRACEY: (O.S.) No, thank you.
ANOTHER BOOM.
Tracey edges the barrel of a gun into the FG, holding it on the others in the bridge.
MAL: Tracey, what are you doing?
TRACEY: I said NO! Those bastards up there ain't gonna yank out this million-credit meat and leave me bleedin'-- (turns gun on Wash) Now turn off that radio!
Another depth charge EXPLODES, closer, louder, Jayne braces himself, bolting instinctively to his feet as more ICE SHARDS rain down on the ship.
JAYNE: Ruttin' twerp's gonna get us killed!
TRACEY: (loud, arresting) Oh, don't you move! Don't anybody move! (gun back to Wash) All right. We need to power up. We need to run! NOW!
Book takes a slow step toward Tracey. Tracey swings the gun at him, the model of panicky-guy-with-gun-in-over-his-head and-ready-to-go-postal.
BOOK: Put that thing down, boy. You have no idea --
TRACEY: Ah, shut it, shepherd! Or I swear to your God I will shoot you dead if you do not. (manic) Sarge--Zoe-- What are you doin' with this bible-thumper?
He turns to Mal, whose hands are slightly raised, eyes boring back at Tracey. ANOTHER BOOM.
MAL: Wash. Call the cops.
Wash's eyebrows raise; he points gingerly at Tracey's gun.
WASH: But --
TRACEY: I'll kill him. I'll put a hole right through him.
MAL: You mailed your ugly business to Zoe and me, Tracey, cash-on-delivery. I'll go to Hell before I watch you turn and bite us for the favor --
ANOTHER BOOM, even closer. Ice, clatter, scary.
MAL: Wash. Call 'em up. Tell 'em we'll meet 'em topside.
TRACEY: No, thank you!
MAL: Do it.
Wash does that funny-under-pressure nod of his, turns to the radio, reaches for the switch--
TRACEY: NO!
Tracey swings his gun off Mal and fires a SHOT at the radio console. He misses, and it RICOCHETS off the railing above it, grazing across Wash's temple, throwing his head back.
Tracey stands, mouth open. He looks down, and the camera tilts down, to his chest, where a BIG RED HOLE gapes. He looks up at Zoe, who holds her gun on him.
TRACEY: (amazed) You, you shot me...
Zoe cocks her gun, sending the spent shell flying.
ZOE: Damn right.
MAL: That's enough shootin'
ANOTHER BOOM. A little dazed, but still standing, Tracey backs out of the bridge. Zoe covers him as she calls to Wash.
ZOE: Wash --? Sweetie --?
Wash holds out a bloody hand.
WASH: Ow?
MAL: Everybody calm down.
 
INT. SERENITY - FOREDECK - CONTINUING
Tracey backs down the stairs into the foredeck, gun covering the door to the bridge.
ANOTHER DEPTH CHARGE shakes the ship.
Kaylee races into the foredeck from behind him, not seeing his gun.
MAL: (O.S.) Kaylee! Get out of here!
Tracey turns on her, swings an arm around her, pulling her against him as a shield. Mal is at the bridge door, gun out.
TRACEY: Gorram it, Mal!
He fires a wild shot toward the door, Mal ducks. Tracey herds Kaylee toward the exit to the cargo bay stairs--
 
INT. SERENITY - STAIRS/CARGO BAY
As Tracey pushes Kaylee down the stairs, her arm in his white-knuckled grip.
TRACEY: (still manic) I probably scared you back there a little bit, didn't I? Did you see the look on his face. Great.
She sees the blood pouring down his shirt front.
KAYLEE: You're really bleedin'.
TRACEY: Yup. They shot me.
KAYLEE: Wh-why?
ANOTHER BOOM.
They get to the catwalk, and he drags her toward shuttle II's airlock.
TRACEY: 'Cause they, they want to sell me off... You won't let them do that, will you, Kaylee? 'Cause, you know, I think you and I really... a moment back there --
Kaylee digs in her heels at the shuttle's entrance.
KAYLEE: Tracey--
TRACEY: You know, Kaylee. I need you to fly me out of here. Can we take this shuttle and just go? Didn't we have a moment back there? 
ANOTHER BOOM.
KAYLEE: I ain't goin' anywhere with you.
MAL: Nobody's going anywhere, private.
Mal walks down the stairs from above, gun trained on Tracey.
KAYLEE: Whoa, Captain! What is goin' on?
He pulls Kaylee back into shield position, gun now raised to her head. He's nothing but panic in a pair of pants now.
TRACEY: Don't make me do it.
ANOTHER BOOM. Mal gets to the catwalk, angry, but cool as cucumber slices. Zoe and Jayne move slowly down the stairs behind him.
MAL: Far as I can see, nobody's made you do anything. You brought this on yourself. Got in over your head with those stone cold gut-runners, then you panicked, brought the whole mess down on all of us...
As he was speaking, we saw Jayne, easing himself onto the catwalk across the bay, gun in hand, quiet like a kitty.
TRACEY: That ain't what happened --
MAL: Ah yes, that's what happened. I'm startin' to think that trail of bodies Womack was talkin' about, I'm thinkin' some of that trail was left by you...
TRACEY: (sweating profusely) And you ain't left a trail of bodies, work you do? Hmm? 'Cause your rep speaks elsewise.
MAL: Weren't the bodies of people helpin' me out.
TRACEY: And you're helpin' out lots, 'cause I needed a chest wound.
MAL: That can be seen to.
TRACEY: Do you think I'm stupid?
MAL: In every way possible.
BOOMING again.
TRACEY: Do you know why I picked you and Zoe? Because you're saps. You reppin' out as stone killers, but I still remember the ol' Sarge with his stories and his homilies, of glory and honor.
MAL: Maybe you shoulda listened.
TRACEY: Yeah, well what are you now? What are we now, Mal?
Mal looks up, around, then back to Tracey.
MAL: See there? Hear that quiet? Means the call's already been made.
TRACEY: (breaking up) Well, that call... That call means you just murdered me.
Mal flicks his eyes towards Jayne, who responds by LOUDLY COCKING HIS GUN. Panicky-panic, Tracey spins, trying to see where the sound came from, as Kaylee wrenches free. Mal FIRES, hitting him in the chest, inches from the first wound.
Tracey slumps down.
MAL: (voice catches) No, son. Murdered yourself. (as Tracey writhes on the catwalk floor) I just carried the bullet a while.
Zoe and Mal look at Tracey, then at each other, eyes speaking: "there's no way in hell he's gonna make it."
 
EXT. PLANET - DAY
Serenity parked nose-to-nose in front of the cop ship, on a plain of glacial ice.
 
INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - DAY
The airlock doors slide open -- the blinding glare of sun on snow -- out of that, Womack and his two men emerge, walking up the ramp into the cargo bay, guns drawn.
Womack stops, confronted by Jayne, who stands above him on a set of stairs in the bay, BIG GUN trained on Womack.
WOMACK: Well, now... Somebody left their dog off the leash... (cold low growl) I been shot too many times to be scared by a gun, boy.
A voice trails thin from above.
TRACEY: Womack...
Womack looks up, sees Tracey propped up against the catwalk railing, sees the BLOOD dripping down through the grates.
TRACEY: (delirious chuckle) I think I broke your junk...
Mal appears over the railing, gun on the cops as well.
MAL: Little problem during shipping.
WOMACK: Don't think I have to tell you folk the kind of trouble you're in. Wetware smugglin', resistin', fleein' an officer a' the law... I'm sure a search of this ship'll come up with another few felonies.
Book walks out from behind some crates and stuff.
BOOK: You won't be searching the ship, Womack.
WOMACK: That so?
BOOK: It is. You won't be taking us in. Nor the boy who's dying up there.
WOMACK: I'm authorized to kill as I like, shepherds not withstanding.
Book is so cool here it's making my hands sweaty.
BOOK: Why is it you didn't call in for back-up? (Womack skips a beat) There's a Fed station eighty miles from where you're standing. (walks closer) You got your command stripes at the Silverhold colonies. Puts you about eight sectors away from your jurisdiction... Since you're running this job on the side you took pains...
Womack raises his gun toward Book. The other two guys nervously follow suit.
BOOK: ...took pains to keep your presence here secret. I don't imagine it'd bother anyone if we laid your bodies to rest at the bottom of one of these canyons.
A GUN COCK echoes from above; Zoe's positioned a ways down the side catwalk, with a clean shot.
The cops lower their guns.
Womack looks up at the dying Tracey, at the various guns trained on him, crunching the numbers. Finally, he spits on the ground.
WOMACK: It's damaged goods, anyhow.
They start backing out of the bay. Jayne and Book slowly follow them, Jayne still aimed rock solid on Womack's face. As they get past the open airlock doors:
WOMACK: That hat makes you look like an idiot.
This, oddly, hits Jayne. He frowns with affront. Book hits the airlock button and the doors SLIDE SHUT.
Up on the catwalk, Tracey's life ebbs fast. Mal and Simon crouch by him. Zoe enters, crouches. Kaylee looks on, arms folded.
TRACEY: (coughs) So.. .That was the plan? (Mal nods) That was a... That was a good plan.
MAL: I think so.
TRACEY: Um. You... You weren't that far off about me bein' stupid. I...I never could get my life workin' right. Not once after the war. (to Kaylee) Kaylee. Um. I'm so sorry. I...I didn't... (to Mal) Sarge...?
MAL: Right here.
TRACEY: Um. That stupid message of mine, and, and... I was tryin' to play you guys. And now... You'll, you'll do it? You'll get me home?
ZOE: Yeah.
MAL: Well, you know the old saying.
TRACEY: (sad little laugh) "When you can't run, you crawl... and when you can't crawl, when you can't do that --"
Coughs again, this time a trickle of blood falls from his lips.
ZOE: "You find someone to carry you."
Tracey nods, his eyes fluttering, dying.
Head slumps. Dead. Sad.
 
EXT. SNOWY HOMESTEAD - DAY
Tracey's body is carried down ramp by Mal and Zoe, others in attendance. Before them is a homestead, a large EXTENDED FAMILY stands there awaiting their dead son.
As they hand the body over:
TRACEY: (V.O.) It's funny. We went to the war never looking to come back, but it's the real world I couldn't survive. You two carried me through that war. Now I need you to carry me just a little bit further. If you can... Tell my folks I wanted to do right by them, and that I'm at peace and all...
Each crew member expresses his sorrow in his own way. Wash stands, his head bandaged, head bowed. Kaylee gives Tracey's family his recorder. Jayne removes his hat. Kaylee moves next to Simon and quietly takes his hand in hers.
TRACEY: (V.O.) When you can't run anymore, you crawl, and when you can't do that, well, yeah, you know the rest... 
Mal stands apart, alone, looking back.


EXT. WASTELAND - DAY
SLOW CAMERA PAN across a flat vista of shattered rock. Barren. Lunar. PAN ONTO a MAN seated a short distance away on the ground. His side is to us, and he is BUCK NAKED. It's MAL REYNOLDS. He lifts his head, nodding to himself as he takes in his surroundings.
MAL: (flatly) Yep... That went well.

EXT. DUST PLANET - NIGHT
A LARGE CRATE slams down onto the ground, hard. The two smugglers who were hefting it straighten, turning to go. WIDEN to see that Mal stands close by, arms crossed.
A PILE OF SIMILAR CRATES lies in the dust around Mal. Other SMUGGLERS carry more crates, adding to the pile. (All smugglers sport holstered firearms) They are ferrying them from the lowered FREIGHT PLATFORM of a SPACESHIP, which looms overhead.
MONTY: (O.S.) Malcolm Reynolds!
A VERY LARGE MAN steps off a ladder that goes up from the platform to the belly of the ship, beaming at Mal.
He's a big, gut-toting bear of a man. Not pretty. Not in the least. Think of a greasy Brad Garrett with bad teeth.
MONTY: Y'old son-of-a-- Com'ere!
MAL: Oh hey Monty --
He sweeps a mildly protesting Mal up into a bear-hug, lifting him off his feet for a beat.
MAL: (wheezes) How--you--do--in'?
Monty releases him, one mitt still clapped on Mal's shoulder, shaking it with rough welcome.
MONTY: They didn't tell me you were picking up this leg of the run.
MAL: Yeah, things were a little slow. Figured to do a little honest smuggling 'tween jobs.
MONTY: Where's that sorry-ass ship a' yours?
As they speak, Monty's ND CREW continues off-loading the crates, passing in and out of frame.
MAL: Monty, two boats like ours meeting on an empty rock like this, it just screams contraband to the Fed. Or have you forgotten that time you got pinched on Beylix?
MONTY: (points to his own temple, nodding) Always thinking, ain't ya. Smarts. That's what you got. Smarts.
MAL: (shrugs) OK. (looks closer at Monty) Something's different.
MONTY: (smiles proudly) Yup. 
MAL: You look -- there's something -- (Monty strokes his chin) --the beard! You shaved off the soup- catcher!
MONTY: Yup.
MAL: I thought you were gonna take that ugly chin-wig to the grave --
MONTY: (chuckles) So did I. But she didn't much like my whiskers...
MAL: She--?
MONTY: (calls out) Bridgit! (to Mal) What the hell am I thinking, I got to introduce you to the missus!
MAL: Monty! You've fallen from our noble bachelor ranks?
MONTY: Wasn't looking to, but she kinda swept me off my feet. Bridgit!
A woman hurries to them obscured by the smuggly bustle.
MAL: Well, she must be a rare specimen indeed.
MONTY: That don't begin to cover it. Mal, I want you to meet my Bridgit.
And she steps out from behind Monty, smiling -- until she recognizes Mal. A beat as he and SAFFRON look at each other.
Saffron sweeps a foot under a Smuggler's leg, tripping him forward, pulling his gun from its holster as he falls, and pirouetting over his body as he hits the dirt, coming out of the spin with the gun locked on Mal's head, just as Mal's gun is flashing from his holster, locked on hers -- a Woo-off. They are frozen, Monty right in the middle, nonplussed.
MONTY: So... you guys have met.


EXT. DUST PLANET - NIGHT
Right where we left off. Mal and Saffron sidestep, guns trained, slowly circling, very intense. Monty stands nearby, brow knitted with confusion.
MONTY: Mal -- why you got a piece trained on my wife?
MAL: She ain't your wife, Monty --
MONTY: Hunh? I married 'er, didn't I?
MAL: Yeah, so did --
Mal's cut off before he can finish, because in the instant Mal's eyes flick toward Monty, Saffron scissors up a high kick, knocks the gun out of Mal's hand. She has the drop on Mal for an instant, but doesn't fire. Mal lunges, sweeping her arm to the side, catching her wrist in his grip and squeezing hard. She drops his gun. Saffron throws her head forward, smashing into Mal's nose painfully.
MAL: Gaaah!
MONTY: Bridget!
Mal staggers back, buffeted by a series of punches from Saffron. Mal fires one punch back, catching her on the chin and knocking her to the ground.
MONTY: Mal!
She lands on her back, mostly unfazed, and instantly rolls for the gun a short distance away. Just as she almost reaches it, Mal sails in on top of her, tackling her flat.
SAFFRON: Get OFF!
She swings an elbow back, hits the side of Mal's head hard. He reels, she rolls on top of him, hands around his throat. He does the same, and now they're strangling each other. They do this for a vicious beat, until --
MONTY: (O.S.) (roars) Gorramit! That's enough!
Monty's big hands drop into frame, lifting them both off the ground and pulling them apart. They're both breathless, Mal's got a BLOODY NOSE.
MONTY: Now what the hell is goin' on here? Whaddya mean she ain't my wife?
MAL: She ain't your wife... cause she's married to me.
SAFFRON: (also huffing) Don't listen to him!
MAL: It's true. Half-a-year back, out at the Triumph Settlement. Didn't call herself "Bridgit" then. It was "Saffron." Hitched me by surprise, got on my ship, and tried to steal it out from under me... She's as cold as ice and dead crazy on top of it.
SAFFRON: You're a liar, Malcolm Reynolds!
MONTY: Oh, he's a lot of things. But a liar he ain't. All the terrible thick we been through, he ain't never lied to me, not even once. (pointed to Saffron) And I never got to telling you his name.
Saffron drops all pretense -- the jig is up.
SAFFRON: Oh, hell. Fine. Be like that.
She pulls away from Monty and starts neatening herself up, brushing back her hair, wiping the dirt from her face.
MONTY: (hurt) You said you loved me for me...
Mal looks at Monty, saying with tender frankness:
MAL: Believe me, Monty. She says that to all the boys.
Off of Monty's crestfallen face we CUT TO:

EXT. DUST PLANET - NIGHT
MONTY'S SHIP as its engines FIRE UP, whipping a small cloud of dust around the tiny figures of Saffron and Mal. (Note: the design of this ship must be such that it can take off without its engines incinerating what is directly beneath it.)
SAFFRON stands with her arms crossed, looking up irritably, lit by the OS glare of the ship's lights. Mal is in the BG, with the crates. He dabs at his bloody nose with a white kerchief. Monty's voice echoes down over the SHIP'S LOUDSPEAKER, choked with hurt.
MONTY: (OS) Damn you, Bridget! Damn you ta Hades! You broke my heart in a million pieces! You made me love you, and then y-- I SHAVED MY BEARD FOR YOU, DEVIL WOMAN!
SAFFRON: Whatever.
After a beat, a DUFFEL BAG drops into the frame from above, SLAMMING into the ground. The OS ship pulls away with a burst of engine thrust, the light from it fading.
SAFFRON: [BUN tyen-shung duh ee-DWAY-RO.]
She moves to the duffel bag, crouches, unzips it, and roots around inside. The barrel of Mal's pistol enters frame, pressing against her temple.
MAL: You're goin' to wanna pull your claw out of that bag, nice and slow.
SAFFRON: Relax. I'm not going for a gun or anything.
She slowly pulls a small cylinder out of the bag, and shows it to him, cranking it. It's lipstick.
SAFFRON: Just freshening up.
She's about to apply it when Mal snatches it and hucks it out into the OS desert.
MAL: You and lipstick is a dangerous combination, as I recall. (gestures with gun) Now get up and turn around.
She does so, with some impatience. Mal moves in and frisks her, trying to be businesslike, but she responds in a way that crackles with sexual tension.
SAFFRON: Oh... Yeah... Just like old times.
MAL: We don't have any old times. I just don't want you pullin' a pistol out of... of anywhere...
She writhes into him a little as he finishes frisking her.
SAFFRON: (super sexy) Mmmm. You missed a spot...
Mal gives her a rough shove and she stumbles forward a step.
MAL: Can't miss a place you never been.
She am freaky -- turns to him not with anger, but with practiced emotion -- playing to Mal as if they have a troubled, but real marriage.
SAFFRON: Marriage is hard work, Mal, I know it... But that doesn't mean we have to give up... (moves closer to him) Sure, we've had our spats. Maybe I made some bad decisions along the way.
MAL: Oh, you're a tweaked one, you are.
SAFFRON: (smiles) But face it, hubby, I'm really hot.
MAL: Uh huh. (waves gun at her) Start walkin'.
SAFFRON: Walking? Walking where?
MAL: Pick a direction. Just don't turn around.
SAFFRON: Come on. Mal.
MAL: This is my scrap of nowhere. You go on and find your own.
SAFFRON: You can't just leave me here, on this lifeless piece of crap moon...
MAL: Sure I can.
SAFFRON: I'll die.
MAL: Well, as a courtesy, you might start getting busy on that, cause all this chatter ain't doin' me any kindness.
Saffron sits down on her duffel bag with a defiant pout. But she seems done with the full court press, more herself now.
SAFFRON: Why don't you just go ahead and shoot me, then?
MAL: I dunno. (thinks on this) Why didn't you shoot me? Back there, when I took my eyes off you for a split? Shame to say it, but I gave you the window.
SAFFRON: (condescending sigh) You and Monty, you fought in the war together, right? (he nods) I could smell that. The war buddy bond is a tough one to crack. I knew if I shot you I'd lose Monty anyway. You just had a better hand of cards this time.
MAL: It ain't a hand of cards. It's called a life. I've got a better life than you. And that's just barely, and just cause I don't spend my every waking hour pissing all over it, like some folks I'm holdin' a gun on...
Saffron flashes a tight, insincere smile.
SAFFRON: Touché, mon amour. (as she stands) Seriously, Mal. You have to give me a ride.
MAL: (bitter laugh) Woman, you are completely off your nut.
SAFFRON: I won't make trouble. You can stick me in one of those crates if you like. Just don't leave me he-
Mal SHOOTS. A bullet kicks up the dust about three feet from her. A beat. She sticks out her tongue. ANOTHER BULLET kicks up dust, two feet away. Another beat. She bends, lifting one strap of her heavy bag. She starts dragging it off, struggling. Then she stops and turns again.
SAFFRON: This was all your fault, you know. I had a perfect crime lined up.
MAL: Sure. You were stealing a man's beard.
SAFFRON: No you ! [HOE-tze duh PEE-goo!] A million-square job. The big time. I was going to cut Monty and his crew in, but you screwed that royal.
MAL: (raises gun again) Odd, but I don't think I'll be losing sleep over it.
SAFFRON: I've got the layout, entrance codes, believe me, this thing practically robs itself.
MAL: Bye now.
SAFFRON: I'm handing you a fortune on a gold platter, sweetheart! Don't you even want to hear the details?
Mal considers that for a beat, then looks at the kerchief, BLOODIED from his nose. He raises the gun again.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - NIGHT
JAYNE stands by the cargo bay door, pulling on leather work gloves. Behind him, BOOK, SIMON, KAYLEE, and ZOE stand at the ready
JAYNE: Sure you're up to liftin' this stuff? Crates are fair heavy, I gather.
The engines are HUMMING, and the bay ROCKS a bit as Serenity sets down. Kaylee nods, enthusiastic.
KAYLEE: I can handle it.
JAYNE: Wasn't talkin' to you.
Jayne smiles at Simon, who mocks a pained expression. Jayne hits a button -- the airlock opens, and the ramp beyond it starts to lower.
The lowering ramp reveals Mal, standing in front of the pile of crates, alone. He doesn't look too happy. He has a wadded up TWIST OF TORN KERCHIEF in each nostril, to stem the blood.
JAYNE: Woah there, cap... Tell me you didn't get into a fight with Monty.
KAYLEE: Really? But I thought we loved Monty! (to Zoe, sincere question) Don't we love Monty?
ZOE: Sweetie, if he had a tussle with that sasquatch, we'd be in the dirt right about now, scoopin' up the Captain's teeth.
Mal stomps up the ramp, holding them all in an even glare.
ZOE: Ain't that so, sir?
MAL: You know what? I don't particular want to talk about it. Now we got work. Let's shut up and do it.
Zoe looks from the Captain to the others, then back, eyebrows raised. WASH comes down the cargo bay stairs closest to the bridge, stops by Mal
WASH: Inara was asking for you. Wanted to -
Mal walks away.
WASH: So later with the talking then.
Wash walks down toward camera, mouthing words to Zoe and Book, who carry one of the crates up the ramp.
WASH: (mouthed silently) 'What happened?'

EXT. SPACE
Just a stock shot of Serenity for transition please.

INT. SERENITY - INARA'S SHUTTLE
Mal enters INARA's chamber -
MAL: Heard you were looking for me?
- to find her seated, preparing tea. Her whole attitude is formal, yet inviting...
INARA: I was. Care to sit?
He does, slowly.
INARA: I was hoping to talk a little business. Would you like some tea?
He stands again, less slowly.
MAL: Okay, what's the game?
INARA: I offered you tea.
MAL: After inviting me into your shuttle of your own free will, which makes two events without precedent and which makes me more'n a little skittish.
INARA: Honestly, Mal, if we can't be civilized and talk like-
MAL: I'm plenty civilized. You're using wiles on me.
INARA: I'm using what?
MAL: Your feminine wiles. Your companion training, your some-might-say uncanny ability to make a man sweaty and/or compliant, of which I have had just about enough today.
INARA: Maybe this isn't the best time.
MAL: It's a fine time. Just talk plain is all.
INARA: I'm not sleeping with you, Mal.
Beat.
MAL: Uh, no, I think I would have noticed if you were. My keenly trained... senses would have...
INARA: You're not my lover. Neither are you my mother, My House Mistress or anyone who has the slightest say in how I conduct my affairs.
MAL: Well enough. So?
INARA: So let me conduct my affairs!
MAL: Who's keeping you from -
INARA: I haven't had a client in three weeks. Backwater moons, slums frontier planets without so much as a temple built -
MAL: We go where the work is!
INARA: There's all kinds of work, Mal
MAL: And ours is the kind the Alliance shuts you down for. I opt to stay off the radar -
INARA: There's plenty of worlds where both of us could work. We used to visit them, remember?
MAL: [EE-chee shung-hoo-shee.] Are you saying I'm doing this deliberate on account of you? There's some reason I don't want you on the job?
INARA: Is there?
MAL: (sighing, pacing) Well this is one of the crazier things I've heard today and when I tell you about the rest of my day, you'll appreciate --
INARA: Mal, I'm not accusing you of anything, it's just--
MAL: Hey, no, we'll just set course for Planet of the Lonely Rich and Appropriately Hygienic Man. I'll just tell Wash, we can park there for a month.
INARA: (rises as well) Not all of your work is illegal. And he--
MAL: What, you're trying to get me off the job now?
INARA: -- And the best job you ever pulled was on a central planet!
MAL: How about I stay out of your whoring -
INARA: That didn't take long -
They're right in each other's faces now, goin' at it.
MAL: And you stay out of my thieving. I know my business plenty well, thank you.
INARA: Right. You're a criminal mastermind. What was the last cargo we snuck past the Alliance to transport?
MAL: We made a perfectly good piece-
INARA: What was the cargo?
MAL: They were dolls!
INARA: They were little geisha dolls with big heads that wobbled!
MAL: People love those!
INARA: And what exactly was our net profit on the famous wobbly-headed doll caper?
MAL: "Our" cut? You're in the gang now?
INARA: Well, since I can't seem to find work as companion, I might as well become a petty thief like you!
Beat. Oops. The air goes out of both of them.
MAL: Petty.
INARA: (backtracking) I didn't mean petty.
MAL: What did you mean?
INARA: (meekly) [Suo-SHEE?]
MAL: That's chinese for petty.
INARA: No, that's a narrow... there's nuances of meaning that...
MAL: Maybe you shoulda stuck with your wiles.
INARA: Don't put this all on me, Mal. You know you haven't been after serious work in a -
MAL: Serious work? You wanna know what I -
He stops himself.
INARA: What?
MAL: Nothing.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - SOON AFTER
Mal, alone, descends the stairs into the cargo bay. He goes to the crates, scanning over them for a moment, finding one that has TWO BULLET HOLES in its lid. He pries it open, pulls the lid away and looks in.
MAL: All right. Tell me more about this job a' yours.
OVER HIS SHOULDER INTO CRATE
Where, frowning with discomfort, wedged kinda sexily into a shipment of PROTEIN PACKETS, lies Our Mrs. Reynolds...


INT. SERENITY - DINING AREA
Jayne, Zoe, Wash and Kaylee are all gathered at the dining room table. Presently they're staring a bit open-mouthed at -- MAL AND SAFFRON standing variously before them as Saffron makes her pitch.
SAFFRON: The mark's name is Durran Haymer. Maybe one of the biggest collectors of Earth-That-Was artifacts in the 'verse. Guy's got warehouses full of stuff. But his prize piece is sitting in his parlor -- an antiquity of unspeakable value: The Mexican. The original hand-held laser pistol. One of only two known to still exist. The forerunner of all modern laser technology. Haymer got lucky, picked it up during the war for nothing.
MAL: But it wasn't just luck. (then) Tell them.
SAFFRON: Haymer's Alliance. Bio-weapons expert during the war. He'd target neighborhoods with valuables, wipe out every living soul without ever damaging the goods. Go in, take whatever he wanted.
MAL: He's living fat on a private estate on Bellerophon.
Saffron tosses some future computer disks onto the table.
SAFFRON: I managed to get ahold of his schedule for the next 18 months -- the layout of the estate grounds... and every security code for the place.
No one moves to touch them
MAL: Saffron's got a notion we can just walk in -- take The Mexican right off his shelf.
More with the staring. Finally Wash speaks.
WASH I'm confused...
SAFFRON: (ahead of him) You're asking yourself if I've got the security codes, why don't I just go in and grab it for myself -- why cut you in?
WASH: No. Actually... I was wondering... (to Mal, suddenly) What's she doing on the ship!? Didn't she try to kill us?
SAFFRON: (rolls her eyes) Please. Nobody died last time. (suddenly unsure) Right? Where's the old guy with the hair?
WASH: We're in space. How'd she get here?
MAL: She hitched.
WASH: I don't recall pulling over...
MAL: Look. Point is, there's more'n one of us here wouldn't mind sticking it to a < monkey raping > [Chiang-BAO HOE- tze duh] Alliance bastard. Besides that, this could be a very lucrative venture for all of us. This ain't no wobbly-headed doll caper. This here's history.
Jayne's been thinking very hard. Raises his hand
JAYNE: Okay. I got a question. If she's got the security codes, why don't she just go in a grab it for herself -- why cut us in?
A beat as they stare. Then:
SAFFRON: Good point. Getting through the door and putting our hands on the Mexican is easy. Getting out with it... that's the tricky part.
MAL: It's tagged and coded. Second it passes through the door -- alarms, security, feds.
SAFFRON: This isn't a one-woman operation. To do this right, I need...
INARA: (O.S) Idiots.
They turn. Inara has entered the room.
SAFFRON: Partners.
INARA: Dupes. And that's what you'll all be if you trust her.
MAL: Could be that's so. Lord knows ain't none of us "criminal masterminds." So if you got something better, Inara -- something not "petty" -- we'd sure be willing to hear it.
A beat as Inara and Mal hold the look between them. Saffron doesn't hate the tension that's evident here. Finally:
INARA: (turns and goes) < Idiots. All of you. > [Nee mun DOH shr sagwa.]
MAL: (looks back to gang) Okay. So the question remains -- how do we get the artifact out without setting off the alarms?
KAYLEE: You don't. Not through the door, anyway. (reaches for the disk) This the layout?
SAFFRON: Full blueprints of the entire grounds.
KAYLEE: Could be we look hard enough, we find a way.
Mal smiles, that's what he likes to hear.
MAL: You dig into that, little Kaylee. (looks to Zoe) Zoe. You ain't said a word. Time to weigh in.
ZOE: Take sounds ripe enough. That's assuming we can fence it.
SAFFRON: I know a guy on Persephone. He's already got half a dozen buyers on the bid. The split is gonna be sweet.
ZOE: But Inara's not wrong -- (eyes on Saffron) -- she can't be trusted.
MAL: I ain't asking you to trust her. I'll be with her on the inside the whole time.
SAFFRON: See there? Only one thing you gotta do if you want to be a rich woman, hon -- and that's get over it.
ZOE: Mmmm. Okay.
POW -- Zoe hauls off and slugs Saffron in the mouth. She goes down on her tush. Everyone's a little astonished.
ZOE: You, too. Hon. (then, to Mal) I'm in.
Off nobody offering to help Saffron up --

INT. SIMON'S ROOM - DAY
Jayne is dumping off a bunch of food and water packets, talking to Simon and River.
JAYNE: Captain says you're to stay put. Doesn't want you runnin' afoul of his blushin' psychotic bride. She figures out who you are, she'll turn you in 'fore you can... say... "don't turn me in, lady".
SIMON: The bounty on us just keeps getting more exciting.
JAYNE: (busying himself) Well, I wouldn't know.
RIVER: (looking at Jayne) She's a liar.
JAYNE: That don't exactly set her apart from the rest of us. And the plunder sounds fun enough.
RIVER: She's a liar and no good will come of her.
JAYNE: Well, I say as a rule that girlfolk ain't to be trusted.
RIVER: Jayne is a girl's name.
JAYNE: Well Jayne ain't a girl. (to Simon) She starts on that "girl's name" thing, I'm a show her good an' all I got man parts.
SIMON: I'm trying to think of a way for you to be cruder. It's just not coming.
JAYNE: I just heard enough ab --
SIMON: (wearily dismissive) < Go far away very fast. > [KWAI chur hun-rien duh di fahng.]
JAYNE: And I WAS gonna leave you a deck of cards...
He goes, shutting the door behind him.
SIMON: Great. Another exciting adventure in sitting.
RIVER: Afraid.
SIMON: We'll be okay. Why the captain is trusting that < remorseless harridan > [BOO hway-HUN duh PUO-foo] is beyond --
RIVER: Not her. Jayne.
SIMON: (amused) Afraid? Since when?
RIVER: Since Ariel.
Simon is no longer amused.
RIVER: Afraid we'll know.

INT. SERENITY - CARGO BAY - CATWALKS
Zoe is headed up the catwalks from the cargo bay, Inara comes down the stairs leading from the bridge, heading to her shuttle.
ZOE: We should be on Bellerophon by oh- six. I figure the job should be-
INARA: Please. I really don't wanna know.
ZOE: At least it's your kind of world. You got appointments made?
INARA: The minute we hit atmo, I'm gone. I've booked a few choice clients, should help me get my mind off Mal's descent into lunacy -
ZOE: (curious) What happens if you got an appointment coming and you ain't finished the one you're at?
INARA: Overbooking is a cardinal sin. Clients must feel the experience is timeless. Only thing worse is a badly faked fall.
ZOE: See, that's where me and Companionship part ways. I never could work the notion of pretending a man was gettin' it done when he wasn't.
INARA: So you've never pretended to fall.
ZOE: Well, never is a strong word... sometimes it's easier.
INARA: What about with Wash?
ZOE: One time. Poor boy was bone-tired...
INARA: And?
ZOE: He knew. Son of a bitch called me on it.
INARA: That's the one you marry.
ZOE: Damn right.
Zoe starts to leave.
INARA: Zoe. Don't let Mal trust her.
ZOE: Thought you didn't care about the job.
INARA: I really don't. I just want there to be someone around to pick me up when I'm done.
ZOE: < Don't worry. > [FAHNG-sheen.] I got his back. Captain starts thinking with his < dangly piece of flesh > [JAN- doh duh ee-KWAI-ro], I'll step in.
INARA: The man's a moron. Everything Saffron is, is a lie. She'll get the drop on him - which as far as I'm concerned is what he richly deserves.
ZOE: Ain't sayin' it ain't risky. Don't count Mal out, though. He just knows the estate is - 
Inara holds up her hands.
INARA: No details. I meant that. Just be careful.
ZOE: See you when we're wealthy...
They split up, Zoe heading up toward the bridge, Inara going into her shuttle
ANGLE: SAFFRON - has been eavesdropping from above, near the second shuttle. Mal steps out-
MAL: You give me a hand in here. No wandering about, remember? Or I'll stick you back in your crate.
WASH: (V.O) (from the COM) Cap'n?
Mal keeps his eye on Saffron as he hits a nearby button.
MAL: Yeah?
WASH: (V.O) We think we got something...

INT. SERENITY - DINING AREA
Mal, Zoe, Jayne, Wash, Kaylee and Saffron are gathered around the table. Kaylee has the portable display (seen in "Ariel" with the estate schematics. It gets passed around as she and Wash speak:
WASH: Bellerophon Estates... Home to the rich and paranoid... gracious living... ocean views...

EXT. BELLEROPHON - DAY
Ocean as far as the eye can see. Floating about the blue expanse are enormous manors -- estates hovering a mile above the water, complete with greenery, landscaping, etc.
WASH: (V.O.) ... and state-of-the-art security, including local patrols, and multi-code-keys needed at all entrances and exits...

INT. SERENITY - DINING AREA - CONTINUOUS
SAFFRON: Which we have --
WASH: Right. You and Mal will split off in Shuttle II as we make our approach...

EXT. BELLEROPHON - DAY
SERENITY zooms into the shot (continuing CGI shot from before.) Shuttle II splits off from Serenity, veering slightly up. CAMERA STAYS WITH SHUTTLE II as it approaches the floating estate, other flying vehicles coming and going.
WASH: There's a landing port just south of the main house.

INT. SHUTTLE II - DAY
Mal at the helm.
MAL: Prepped for landing. You ready?
Saffron appears from the back, two ENORMOUS FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS in her arms.
SAFFRON: Ready.

EXT. FLOATING ESTATE - DAY
The well manicured grounds. SHUTTLE II lands in the distance. CAMERA PANS to find various DOMESTICS bustling about who carry covered trays, carts loaded with fine China, a BARTENDER setting up an outdoor bar, etc.
WASH: (V.O.) Haymer's throwing a big party this weekend, so you should have no trouble blending with the hired help who'll be there setting up.
CAMERA FINDS Mal and Saffron carrying the flower arrangements, now moving through all of this.
WASH: (V.O.) All you gotta do is get through the back door.

EXT. FLOATING ESTATE - BACK ENTRANCE - DAY
Mal and Saffron arrive at the back door. Saffron pulls out a punch-pad and small round "enabler." Attaches the small cylinder to the door, taps in her code, the cylinder LIGHTS --
MAL: (V.O.) Shouldn't be a problem, unless someone's been less than truthful --
The DOOR CLICKS open, Saffron looks to Mal, smiles...

INT. SERENITY - DINING AREA
Saffron's looking to Mal, here, too.
KAYLEE: The parlor with The Mexican's on the ninth floor. You'll have to disable the display. Won't be any trouble. 'course, once you got your hands on the goods, you can't take it out the front door, nor the back door, nor any door. Every piece of pretty is tagged for the scanners.
SAFFRON: Right. So what do we do? 
KAYLEE: (to Wash) You wanna tell them?
WASH: (waves it to her) It was your genius idea.
KAYLEE: (proud) You chuck it in the garbage.

INT. FLOATING ESTATE - CORRIDORS - DAY
Mal and Saffron exit further into the estate. WE STAY WITH the Housekeeper who moves to a chute opening. She dumps the bag down, then moves to a panel on the opposite wall.
KAYLEE: (V.O.) You hit one little button, and the drone whooshes off with the trash.
The Housekeeper touches the panel. Words appear ONSCREEN: "READY FOR DISPOSAL. YES. NO." She touches "yes."

INT. SERENITY - DINING AREA - CONTINUOUS
SAFFRON: (not really) Brilliant.
KAYLEE: Thanks.
SAFFRON: Oh, except it's idiotic. Those drones take the disposal bins straight to reclamation. Thirty seconds after we hit the button, the booty'll get incinerated.
KAYLEE: Not if we reprogram the bin. Give it new coordinates.

EXT. UNDERNEATH THE FLOATING ESTATE - DAY
Underneath the floating estate, a futuristic dumpster (lined with computer panels) is latched onto the body of the estate. We hear the low THUD of the bag landing inside.
KAYLEE: (V.O.) Once I override the standard guidance protocol, I can tell the disposal bin to go wherever we want.
A flying GARBAGE DRONE GLIDES INTO FRAME, flies towards the dumpster, and its forklift-like claws clamp onto the dumpster with a loud METALLIC KLANG
The dumpster shudders with the impact, then detaches from the structure and the drone whisks it away. Another dumpster drops into place where the other one was.

INT. SERENITY - DINING AREA
SAFFRON: And where would that be?
WASH: The loneliest piece of desert we can find. Here. Isis Canyon. Drone dumps the bin, we claim the goods when we're all together again.
SAFFRON: How do you plan on getting to the bin to reprogram it?
KAYLEE: You get to the loot -- we'll get to the bin.

EXT. SERENITY/UNDERNEATH THE FLOATING ESTATE - DAY
WIDE - CGI. Serenity RISES INTO FRAME, hovering steadily a few feet below the dumpster. Bright sunlight and wind whipping up here.
CLOSER -- THE HATCH opens and Jayne emerges. He's wearing goggles, his thrilling heroics hat and a harness with cable (which dangles at the moment.)
He pulls himself out of the hatch and crawls carefully up the hull and attaches the safety latch of his cable to a rung on the ship.
Now from the hatch Kaylee emerges, also wearing goggles and protection from the wind and cold. She hands up the end of her safety harness to Jayne. He clips it. She hands him out a tool kit. He takes it, then helps her up onto the top of the ship. She crawls toward him on her belly. They're under the bin, now.
He makes her lie flat, one arm over her protecting her as he pulls out his com, speaks into it, telling over the ROARING WIND --
JAYNE: Okay! We're planted!

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - DAY
JAYNE: (V.O., FILTERED) Take us up --
Wash white knuckling it. Zoe at his shoulder. He pulls back on the controls as...

EXT. SERENITY/UNDERNEATH THE FLOATING ESTATE - DAY
Jayne and Kaylee still lying flat. Serenity rises up. Jayne and Kaylee look up as the bottom of the estate looms closer.
JAYNE: (into com) That's good! Hold 'er there.
Kaylee, still face down, pops open her mobile tool kit, hands an electric (space age?) screwdriver to Jayne. Jayne gets to his feet with great care -- reaches up to the control panel side of the trash bin. It's all very precarious now as he sets to work on the panel, removing the face of it....

INT. FLOATING ESTATE - CORRIDOR - DAY
Mal sneaks down a corridor, Saffron standing watch at the other end of the hall. She's keeping an eye on Mal -- specifically, on his ass. Mal turns to her --
MAL: Clear.
She trots down to him, looks at a Palm-like device which displays the house's blueprints.
MAL: Which way?
SAFFRON: Left.
They continue on.

EXT. UNDERNEATH THE FLOATING ESTATE - DAY
Jayne pulls off the front panel of the control mechanism, sets about removing the innards, hands the motherboard down to Kaylee, who begins to work on it.

INT. FLOATING ESTATE - CORRIDOR - DAY
Mal and Saffron move down another corridor -- one that opens into a larger room. Saffron peeks at her Palm as Mal peers into the room, addresses him in a whisper --
SAFFRON: This should be it.
Mal holds up a finger. The sound of VOICES in the other room slowly drifts away. Then he nods and they walk into --

INT. FLOATING ESTATE - PARLOR - DAY
The ENTER into a room that defines opulence. Beautiful furnishings, expensive art on the walls. Memorabilia of Earth-That-Was fills the room. This room alone cost millions to decorate
MAL: < Holy testicle Tuesday. > [Shun-SHENG duh gao-WAHN]
And on the mantel, in the proper place of honor: a Buck Rogers lookin' Laser Gun. It is to phasers what those huge old clunky cell phones were to modern ones.
Mal and Saffron set down their flower displays, move to it. She reaches out. He stays her hand. Holds up a small aerosol-looking can, sprays and a FORCE FIELD becomes visible for a moment. Mal reaches into his flowers, pulls out a mini- tool kit.
MAL: Let's get to work...

EXT. SERENITY/ UNDERNEATH THE FLOATING ESTATE - DAY
Kaylee hands the jerry-rigged motherboard back to Jayne.
KAYLEE: Okay! She's set! (yelling over the roar of wind) Careful! It's hot!
Jayne nods, starts to replace the innards. Serenity rises up a few inches, closing the distance between the bottom of the estate and Jayne's head.
JAYNE: (sharply into com) Gorram it Wash! Hold it steady!

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE
Wash and more with the white knuckles.
WASH: Sorry...
Wash eases off...

EXT. SERENITY/UNDERNEATH THE FLOATING ESTATE - DAY
As Serenity dips ever so slightly, Jayne gets a bit more "head room." Continues to work. Kaylee reacts as she watches:
KAYLEE: Jayne! No! The dyna-ram's live!
He can't hear what she's saying over the ROAR. Glances at her, annoyed --
JAYNE: What?
KAYLEE: (worried) Don't touch the dyna --
ZAP! A BLUE BOLT of energy jumps out of the bin control innards zapping Jayne and knocking him out. He falls and lands hard on the top of Serenity and starts sliding, out like a light. Kaylee instinctively grasps for the tether as Jayne's body slides and rolls, the tether taught. This all happens very fast and off Kaylee's SCREAM!

INT. FLOATING ESTATE - PARLOR - DAY
Mal uses a space-aged allen wrench as he digs into an open panel under the Mexican.
MAL: Where's the trash chute?
SAFFRON: We passed it in the vestibule.
FOOTSTEPS...
SAFFRON: Someone's coming...
Mal quickly shuts the panel, moves away just as -- DURRAN HAYMER, the master of the house, enters the room, freezing both Mal and Saffron. He looks from one to the other, in shock.
DURRAN: (to Mal) You...
Mal waits.
DURRAN: You found her...
He takes Saffron in his arms.
DURRAN: Oh, God, you've brought back my wife!
Off Mal, in jaded awe


INT. FLOATING ESTATE - PARLOR - DAY
Durran holds Saffron close to him... His face is away from Mal's, hers toward Mal. She looks vexed, though she hugs him back.
DURRAN: Oh, my dear...
Mal mimes hitting the guy. Saffron shakes her head slightly, no.
DURRAN: Oh, my own sweet Yolanda...
Mal mouths 'Yolanda?', amused. Durran holds her at arms length.
DURRAN: I thought I would never see you again.
He's fighting welling emotion. To Mal:
DURRAN: Forgive me... I don't mean to make a show...
MAL: Please. I'm the one intruding.
DURRAN: Not at all. I owe you a great debt of thanks.
MAL: Just gave the lady a lift.
DURRAN: You did much more than that. You returned to me the only thing I truly treasure.
MAL: Well, then, this is a day I'll feel good to be me.
DURRAN: Do I owe you any --
MAL: No. Trip weren't even out of our way.
SAFFRON: I promised him 800 square.
MAL: But, no, I never agreed to --
DURRAN: Please. I'd be embarrassed not to make some recompense... In my study, I... Are you hungry? You both look so tired, there's food, or... Yolanda, I'm babbling like a moon brain...
SAFFRON: Hush. We'll both have plenty to say by daybreak.
DURRAN: Six years...
SAFFRON: Is that all?
DURRAN: From the day we found your shuttle --
SAFFRON: They set on me at Parth, these awful men...
MAL: That wasn't me, though. I don't know those men...
SAFFRON: They said they wanted ransom, but they... they sold me... to slavers...
MAL: Also unknown to me...
DURRAN: (ashamed) At first I thought -- well, you disappeared the same day as Heinrich --
SAFFRON: Heinrich?
DURRAN: The security programmer. And he was young, and I'd seen you two talking, and I thought -- but after they found his body...
MAL: They killed Heinrich. Guess he wasn't useful anymore.
DURRAN: (to Saffron) I never stopped looking.
SAFFRON: I knew you wouldn't. (tears and all) That's the thought that kept me alive.
They kiss passionately. Mal looks around, at his nails, at the wall...
SAFFRON: (seductively) We have so much time to make-up...
MAL: Well, that's my cue to skedaddle...
DURRAN: Let me get your money. (to Saffron) You won't disappear again?
SAFFRON: Never.
He goes. A beat, as her loving look hardens.
SAFFRON: We gotta move fast.
As Mal returns to the dismantling of the force field with his sp-allen wrench...
MAL: Yeah, he might come back and hug us in the act.

INT. SERENITY - FOREDECK HALL - BELOW HATCH, LOWERING
Zoe (who's wearing goggles and anti-wind-clothing) and Book struggle to lower the dead weight of an unconscious Jayne into the ship. Zoe is half up the ladder, using Jayne's tether to guide him down to Book. She wears a tether harness vest now.
KAYLEE: (OS) Zoe?
ZOE: I'm comin', Kaylee-- (down to Book) Book -- You got him?
BOOK: I got him -- I got hi--
Zoe unhitches his tether line and Jayne's full weight topples toward Book. He staggers back, pinned against the wall of the corridor by Jayne's bulk.
BOOK: (wheezes) Lord-- this boy weighs-- a solid ton--
He lowers Jayne to the floor. Simon appears, having been summoned. Zoe hitches the tether line to her vest.
ZOE: Doctor, you got yourself a patient to see to.
Simon nods, face clouded with subtle darkness.
SIMON: Yes. I'll take care of it.
Simon moves to assist Book. Zoe hauls herself up out of the hatch.

INT. FLOATING ESTATE - PARLOR -DAY
As Mal continues his dismantling...
SAFFRON: You don't know him. He's everything I said he was.
MAL: Oh, he's a killer of men. Why I'll bet he eats up babies.
SAFFRON: You're wasting time.
He's actually being very efficient while continuing.
MAL: But let's take a breath here, Yolanda. You're sneaking into a place you could walk into as welcome as glad news. What's the math on that?
SAFFRON: The math is you not adding up that Durran Haymer would as soon cut your throat as --
MAL: --You would?
SAFFRON: If possible.
MAL: No. That ain't it at all. You'da knocked him on the brain, were that the case. You don't want him knowing the truth. Unlike all the -- I'm gonna go with hundreds -- of men you've married, you actually want this one to think well of you after you've gone.
A FLASH and WE SEE the FORCE FIELD appear then DISAPPEAR. Mal reaches in easily, grabs The Mexican.
MAL: My god... Could it be that I've just met your real husband?
She has backed up to her flower arrangement, whips out a small gun at him, furious.
SAFFRON: Congratulations, anything else you want on your tombstone, you piece of crap?
DURRAN: Now I'm intruding.
She puts the gun down, genuinely upset that Durran has busted her.
SAFFRON: Durran... This isn't what it looks like...
MAL: Unless it looks like we're stealing your priceless Mexican, 'cause that's what we're doing. Don't ask me about the gun, 'cause that's new.
As he says this, Mal has elegantly moved past Durran, dropped the Mexican into the trash cute just outside the door, hit the button.
DURRAN: Well. I appreciate your honesty. Not, you know, a lot, but --
SAFFRON: Durran, you don't know what he's forced me to --
DURRAN: Stop. Yolanda, please just stop.
There is a terrible sadness in his voice. And a frantic misery in hers:
SAFFRON: Durran... Don't look at me like that.
A beat. She whips the gun at him.
SAFFRON: I said don't look at me like that!
She might just shoot him as we GO TO:

EXT. UNDERSIDE OF FLOATING ESTATE - DAY
Kaylee teeters on precarious tippy-toe, straining to plug a piece of HARDWARE into the top part of the control panel on the dumpster. Zoe steadies her, heels dug in, one hand gripping Kaylee's tether.
KAYLEE: Almost...done... Just have to plug the interface strike-plate back...in...
There's a CLACKING of machinery from the dumpster, and a BEACON LIGHT begins flashing.
ZOE: That's the pick-up call -- they must have dropped the Star... How we doing?
Kaylee strains but can't quite reach.
KAYLEE: (growls) Can't reach it --
Zoe looks to --
ZOE'S POV - of A (CGI) GARBAGE DRONE in the distance, taking a hard turn towards them, like a shark nosing toward its prey.
Zoe speaks into her com.
ZOE: Wash -- we need a little more altitude -- now --
WASH: (O.S.) Working on it, dear --
ZOE: Kaylee--
Kaylee fumbles with the plate as Serenity lurches up another foot or two.
ZOE: KayleeKayleeKaylee--
Kaylee snaps the strike-plate into place.
KAYLEE: Got it!
Zoe pulls hard on Kaylee's tether --
GARBAGE BIN
as Kaylee is yanked hard down OUT OF FRAME, just as the drone SLAMS into place, right where Kaylee had been a micro-second before. It attaches to the dumpster with a DEAFENING BONG.
ZOE AND KAYLEE
Lay prone on top of the ship, exchange a look. Start to scurry forward out of frame and we GO TO:

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - DAY
Wash pilots hard as Zoe's voice crackles in over the com.
ZOE: (O.S.) We're in! Go! Go!
WASH: Copy that--
Wash pulls back on his controls.

EXT. UNDERSIDE OF FLOATING ESTATE - DAY
Serenity drops away from the underbelly, peeling into a dive and sailing off, as the drone detaches the dumpster and flies off in the opposite direction.

INT. FLOATING ESTATE - PARLOR - DAY
Mal inching his way around from the door; Saffron staring down Durran, gun pointed at him...
MAL: Whoa, whoa, let's not get worked up here --
SAFFRON: Are you really so naive? Do you really think your life is anything to me?
Mal is next to his flower arrangement -- whip quick he pulls his own gun from it, is drawn and pointed at her in a heartbeat.
MAL: Okay, we're not killing folk today, on account of our very tight schedule. So why don't you drop that pistola, Yo-Saf-Bridge, and we'll be about our -- (suddenly as fierce as a cop) DROP IT NOW.
He comes at her as he shouts it, his whole attitude wrought with controlled fury, putting the gun to her head. She drops hers to the floor, knowing he means business, but never takes her eyes off Durran. They play everything to each other, even when talking to Mal. (Mal retrieves her gun, pockets it.)
SAFFRON: Did you think I was a princess? That I would stay locked up here in the tower? With you?
DURRAN: I hoped.
SAFFRON: You're a rutting fool.
MAL: Saffron, you wanna finish the damn job? We're short on minutes here. I'm sorry mister --
DURRAN: How long have you been with him?
MAL: Oh we're not together.
SAFFRON: He's my husband.
MAL: Well who in the damn galaxy isn't?
She starts working.
DURRAN: I feel so bad for you.
SAFFRON: Bad for me? I'm not the patsy getting stole from. You had half a brain, you'da called the Feds the minute you saw me.
DURRAN: Oh, I did.
They stop. He points to his ring. It's modern, with a stone like a button. That is a button.
DURRAN: Emergency signal. For kidnappings and the like. I love you, Yolanda, but I couldn't think for a second you were actually here for me.
The sound of approaching cops, etc.
DURRAN: That would be them now.
A beat, as Mal and Saffron fume.
SAFFRON: Men.

EXT. FLOATING ESTATE GROUNDS - CONTINUING
As a trio of POLICE CRUISER-SHIPS descend on the estate, sirens blaring, lights flashing.


INT. FLOATING ESTATE - DAY
We hear the SIRENS and POLICE ANNOUNCING their arrival. Saffron sidles desperately up to Durran...
SAFFRON: Durran, peaches, just call them off. Tell 'em it was a mistake.
DURRAN: You need help, Yolanda.
SAFFRON: I'll do whatever you want... you know how I can make you feel...
DURRAN: Please. You're embarrassing yourself.
She punches him into unconsciousness.
SAFFRON: I'm embarrassing? Who's the dupe on the floor?
She spits on him as Mal comes up, grabs her arm.
MAL: I hate to bring up our imminent arrest during your crazy time, but we gotta move.
He tugs at her and they take off.

EXT. FLOATING ESTATE - GROUNDS - DAY
COPS (armed with those SONIC RIFLES we saw in Ariel) at the doors, speaking into a COM.
POLICE_SERGEANT: ... police. Responding to emergency call code. Request entry, all points.
A BEAT, then the doors BUZZ as the locks give. The cops race inside...

INT. FLOATING ESTATE - CORRIDOR - DAY
Mal and Saffron hoofing it out of here. A COP comes around the corner, heading right at them. The cop is more surprised than they are -- Mal takes him down with a few well- placed moves. Saffron reacts as --
TWO MORE COPS -- appear coming the other way. One of them is raising his SONIC RIFLE.
SAFFRON: [Wahg-ba DAN duh biao-tze.]
Mal drags her along, over the fallen cop. They round the corner just as BOOM! From the Sonic Rifle.

INT. FLOATING ESTATE - BACK ENTRANCE - DAY
They bolt down the glass corridor, the way they came in. Cops appear, coming after them. They push through the door, end up --

EXT. FLOATING ESTATE - BACK ENTRANCE - DAY
Saffron beelines for the security panel, hooks her device onto it, starts working. Mal braces himself against the door.
MAL: What are you doing?
SAFFRON: Shut up and stand back.
Mal backs away from the door just as her enabler BEEPS.

INT. FLOATING ESTATE - BACK ENTRANCE - DAY
A cop reaches for the door -- but it pulls AWAY FROM him. We hear a KA-CHUNK as the door locks.

EXT. FLOATING ESTATE - BACK ENTRANCE - DAY
SAFFRON: Let's go!
She runs off. Mal regards the door and the POUNDING from the trapped cops for a tiny beat.
MAL: (impressed) Good security.
He turns to join her as --
SAFFRON: (O.S.) Mal!
TWO MORE COPS, armed with sonic rifles, coming at them. Saffron is already spinning and kicking at the first one. Mal takes on the second one, hand-to-fist-to-face.
SAFFRON: (calls to Mal, as she fights) Can I have my gun back now, please?
MAL: No!
He lays out the cop he's fighting. Then reaches down and grabs the fallen sonic rifle. Spins on Saffron and the cop she's still engaged with:
MAL: Move!
She dives out of the way as Mal fires a (CGI) SONIC BLAST. Second cop is down for the count. Mal tosses the sonic rifle aside. Saffron goes to grab it. Mal grabs her, yanks her from it.
MAL: Nope. Let's go.
And they do.

INT. FLOATING ESTATE - BACK ENTRANCE - DAY
One of the cops is trying to work the security code pad. No luck. The Sergeant calls into his COM.
POLICE_SERGEANT: Subjects have exited the residence and are on the grounds. Does anyone have visual?
Off the Sergeant's frustration --

EXT. FLOATING ESTATE - DAY
Shuttle II flys away, unpursued.

INT. SHUTTLE II - DAY
Mal pushes buttons, engages autopilot (either burned in graphics or a voice saying as much), and heads to the back as he straps on his holster, back to normal.
Saffron sits on a crate, facing away from him, sullenly ignoring the welling in her eyes.
MAL: That must've been tough.
SAFFRON: Yeah, have yourself a great guffaw.
MAL: I mean it. Six years, you knew he was holding such treasures, you didn't move on him. I gotta figure that's a job you told yourself you'd never take. Till times got hard enough, and the one line you hadn't crossed...
SAFFRON: (turning, fierce) My name's not Yolanda.
MAL: Never entered my mind that it was.
She looks away again. Her tone at first is worldly, bitter -- but there is clearly more underneath.
SAFFRON: I tried. I actually tried. I thought, "this is a decent man. The genuine article."
MAL: A working man, struggling to get by with the barest necessities on his private floating island...
SAFFRON: Yeah, he had money. I thought it would help. That if I had everything... I wouldn't want... 
MAL: Heinrich the Security Programmer?
SAFFRON: You know, I'd forgotten his name.
MAL: Addressing the itch of curiousness, you marry him too?
SAFFRON: No. I didn't kill him either.
MAL: I don't reckon you've killed many. Just put 'em in a position to die easy.
SAFFRON: I should've killed Durran.
MAL: Right. The one guy that don't have it coming. The man who knows you and still loves you, treachery and all. Can't have him walking about.
She does start crying now, balled up, not making any move toward Mal.
SAFFRON: You must be loving this.
MAL: Little bit. I seen you without your clothes on before. Never thought I'd see you naked.
She looks up at him with genuine pleading in her eyes.
SAFFRON: Can people ever change?
MAL: Depends on the person. I'm guessing the pain of this fades away, you'll just go back to being what you are. 
SAFFRON: (small voice) What is that?
He squats before her, takes her chin in his hand.
MAL: (not unkindly) A brilliant, beautiful, evil double crossing snake. Cheer up, weepy: you've earned yourself a boatload of hard cash today. You can question the meaning of life on a floaty island of your own for a while.
SAFFRON: You won't tell anyone about me breaking down?
MAL: I won't.
SAFFRON: Then I won't tell anyone how easily I got your gun out of your holster.
He looks down.
MAL: I take that as a kindness.
They rise, her with the gun pointed at his belly.
SAFFRON: You just may be the most gullible fool I have ever marked. And that makes you special.
MAL: You can riddle me with holes, Yolanda. Won't make what I just saw anything but truth.
SAFFRON: (almost convincing) I played you. From minute one.
MAL: You got me at barrel's end, who am I to argue. What's your move?
SAFFRON: We'll be settling down in the desert. Leave you to set a spell. Oh, and speaking of naked...
MAL: No, now that's just low. SAFFRON Kinda evens things out, don't you think? Pants.
She cocks the hammer, he starts undoing his trousers.
MAL: Don't really see the benefit in all this. However I slip, you're not gonna catch my crew with their trousers down.

INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - DAY
Wash at the controls. Zoe and Kaylee enter.
ZOE: We still clear?
WASH: Nobody's following.
ZOE: Good. Time to turn around. Bin'll be dumped by now. Let's get there before anyone else does.
Wash nods. Pulls on the ship controls. Frowns.
WASH: Can't.
ZOE: What?
WASH: Can't... turn. (still trying) Not getting any tug from the aft alternator --
KAYLEE: What? That don't make no sense... (realizing) Unless...
She turns and runs out, toward the --

INT. SERENITY - ENGINE ROOM
Kaylee goes right for the engine, Zoe and Wash following. She only has to look for a second before knowing what's up --
KAYLEE: Yep. < whores in hell! > [Tah-shr SUO-yo DEE- yure duh biao-tze duh MAH!] The filament in the grav-dampener's stripped.
WASH: Now, who could've possibly done that?
KAYLEE: I can fix it, but she must've put a timer on the motivator and wetwired the dampener with--
ZOE: What does that mean, Kaylee?
KAYLEE: We ain't gonna make the rendezvous. We have to land. Now.
Off their reactions, PRELAP --
MAL: (O.S.) That dirty dirty whore...

EXT. WASTELAND - DAY
MAL's FACE staring up into the sky as CAMERA CRANES UP, the engines of the departing (yet unseen) shuttle whipping wind and dust around Mal.
As CAMERA CONTINUE TO PULL BACK, we see that Mal is very much naked. And standing in the wasteland where we first saw him in the opening. Mal stares at his bare feet and shakes his head as if to say "shoulda seen it coming."

EXT. MOON - DAY
A different wasteland-y part of the moon. The disposal bin sits near Shuttle II, its lid open. From inside the bin, we hear --
SAFFRON: (O.S.) Blaerghchh!
Garbage comes flying out of the bin.
INSIDE THE BIN --
-- is Saffron, digging through the trash, rummaging through moldy fruit, eggshells, and assorted sticky, wet rubbish. Her hair is matted -- basically, she's covered in shit and doesn't look happy about it.
SAFFRON: Where the hell is it...
She keeps digging. Diggy, diggy, diggy -- then she stops, throws her hands up in defeat.
SAFFRON: It's not here.
INARA: (O.S.) Looking for this?
She looks up to see Inara perched on the wall of some nearby ruins, beautiful as always, in her veil and bare midriff ensemble. She points The Mexican.
INARA: Wonder if it works?
Pulls the trigger. Nothing.
INARA: Ah-well. Still worth a fortune. (as she raises a lugar) Anyway, this one works fine. (then) Honey, you look horrific.
SAFFRON: What are you doing here?
INARA: Oh. Just my part of the job. 
SAFFRON: What part of the job?
INARA: (matter of fact) You know, I put on this big act and storm away in a huff, then I fly off, wait for you to doublecross Mal, beat you to the rendezvous spot and grab the loot before you can get to it. (beat) What, you didn't see it coming?
Saffron makes a move; Inara points her lugar.
INARA: Uh-uh. (beat) You know, I'm a little disappointed. Some of the crew's performances weren't quite as nuanced as they could have been. I thought they might tip the fact that we were playing you from the second Mal took you out of that crate. (beat) Oh, well. Guess not.
As she's said this, she's set aside The Mexican and picked up a small REMOTE CONTROL. She aims it at the bin, presses a button -- and the lid SLAMS SHUT on Saffron.
SAFFRON: Wait a minute, wait, you can't -- (SLAM! the lid shuts) -- mmmf mmfff ni ffmm do hmf!
INARA: You're not going to die, you big baby. The authorities will be here in a few hours to dig you out.

INT. SERENITY - INFIRMARY
Jayne fuzzily comes to, looks around. Simon is quietly notating some things, his back to Jayne.
JAYNE: Wah guwwunoh?
SIMON: (not looking around) You got knocked out.
JAYNE: Dih we gedda payoff? Dih we make the money?
SIMON: Can you move your arms and legs?
Jayne looks suddenly worried. Tries -- cannot move anything below his neck.
JAYNE: Dah nod movin'!
SIMON: Do you want to know why?
He turns to Jayne, eerie calm on his face.
SIMON: Your spine. You hit it pretty hard when you fell.
JAYNE: (worried) 'pine?
SIMON: Yes. So I gave you something to knock out your motor functions so you wouldn't wrench it when you came to. Should wear off in half an hour. You'll just be bruised.
JAYNE: 'pine okay?
SIMON: How much did they offer you to sell me and River on Ariel?
Jayne pauses. Now he's worried.
JAYNE: Das crazy talk.
SIMON: Then let's talk crazy. How much.
JAYNE: (looking beyond Simon. calls out) Is anybody there?
River leans in from the doorway looks at him calmly. It's not comforting.
JAYNE: (Quieter) Anybody else?
SIMON: You're in a dangerous line of work, Jayne. Odds are, you'll be under my knife again. Often. So I want you to understand one thing very clearly. No matter what you do, or say, or plot... no matter how you come down on us I will never ever harm you. You're on this table you're safe. I'm your medic, and however little we may like or trust each other, we're on the same crew. Got the same troubles, same enemies and more than enough of both. Now we could circle each other and growl, both sleep with one eye open but that thought wearies me. I don't care what you've done. I don't know what you're planning on doing, but I'm trusting you. I think you should do the same, cause I don't see this working any other way.
He exits. We hold wide on Jayne, thinking on what Simon has said, as River's head pops in the doorway at the other end of frame.
RIVER: Also, I can kill you with my brain.
She pops back out, leaving Jayne to contemplate even more.

EXT. WASTELAND - DAY
ON MAL, who sits naked on a sheared-off stump of stone. He lifts his head, and utters the now familiar:
MAL: Yep... that went well.
REVERSE TO INCLUDE Inara, who has emerged from Serenity's open ramp and is now standing a few feet from Mal. The line is addressed to her.
INARA: You call this "going well"?
MAL: We got the loot, didn't we?
INARA: Yes, but --
MAL: Then I call it a win. What's the problem?
He stands, starts casually walking back to Serenity with Inara, who does her best to not glance at his naughty bits.
INARA: Should I start with the part where you're stranded in the middle of nowhere, or the part where you have no clothes?
MAL: All according to plan.
INARA: Really? I thought the plan was for me to act as a failsafe in case everything else went wrong. Like, for instance, if Saffron disabled Serenity and left you for dead.
MAL: Nonsense. You had a key role to play in this. How sad would you have been if you hadn't gotten to play it?
INARA: Heartbroken.
MAL: See? All according to plan.
They reach Serenity, where Zoe, Wash and Kaylee await. As Mal moves up the ramp --
MAL: Wash, take us out of the world. Zoe, contact Brennert and Ellison, see if they're interested in fencing a priceless artifact for us.
Zoe and Wash just stand there, staring at his nakedity. Yes I said nakedity.
MAL: What?
Zoe and Wash mutter "nothing," "I'll get right to work," etc., as Kaylee smiles at Mal, not at all thrown.
KAYLEE: Good work, Cap'n
MAL: Thanks.
Kaylee goes off as Mal closes the ramp. As the ramp rises, Mal looks out at the wasteland with a certain fondness.
MAL: Good day. Good day.
The ramp shuts and we --
