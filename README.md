Based on my Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree Course

## 1_bike_share
First project. Build a basic NN in python (no tf or Keras).
Using a set of bike usage data train a network so that it can accurately predict the usage.

## 2_cnn_dog_project
First Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project.
In this project, i will build a function that when given an image of a dog, it will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## 3_rnn_simpsons
First Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) project.
In this project, Generate a new scene/part in the style of the simpsons using current scripts.
